Comparisons were made on sections stained with modified Bielschowsky and Thioflavin S. In two cases, comparisons were also made on tissue stained with a monoclonal Alz-50 antibody and an antiserum to A beta (beta-amyloid protein). Despite a marked decline in mental status over several years of follow-up clinical evaluations, there was no consistent significant change in numerical density of plaques or tangles among the four cases. However, we did find fewer primitive plaques in the autopsy specimens. These results from longitudinally evaluated persons with typical AD suggest that although plaques and tangles may serve as adequate markers of the presence of AD, their numerical density within a single neocortical region may not reflect dementia severity. This conclusion supports the results of recent cross-sectional studies on the progression of pathology among persons with AD.",15/06/2005,589-596,Neurobiol Aging,PubMed,PMID: 8295661,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8295661,"Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Cerebral Cortex; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antigens; Bethanechol Compounds; Injections, Intraventricular",

Colocalization experiments revealed that virtually all striatal trkA-immunoreactive neurons (> 99%) coexpressed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) but not p75 nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). Within the septal/diagonal band complex virtually all trkA neurons (> 95%) coexpressed both ChAT and p75 NGFR. More caudally, dual stained sections revealed numerous trkA/ChAT (> 80%) and trkA/p75 NGFR (> 95%) immunoreactive neurons within the nucleus basalis. In the brainstem, raphe serotonergic neurons (45%) coexpressed trkA. Sections stained with a pan-trk antibody that recognizes primarily trkA, as well as trkB and trkC, labeled neurons within all of these regions as well as within the hypothalamic arcuate, supramammilary, and supraoptic nuclei, hippocampus, inferior and superior colliculus, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area of T'sai, and cerebellular Purkinje cells. Virtually all of these other regions with the exception of the cerebellum also expressed pan-trk immunoreactivity in the monkey. The widespread expression of trkA throughout the central neural axis suggests that this receptor may play a role in signal transduction mechanisms linked to NGF-related substances in cholinergic basal forebrain and noncholinergic systems. These findings suggest that pharmacological use of ligands for trkA could have beneficial effects on the multiple neuronal systems that are affected in such disorders as Alzheimer's disease.",22/12/1994,587-611,J Comp Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 7890832 PMCID: PMC2710128,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7890832,"Male; Animals; Rats; Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; Signal Transduction; Neurons; Serotonin; Immunohistochemistry; Choline O-Acetyltransferase; Prosencephalon; Central Nervous System; Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor; Nerve Fibers; Raphe Nuclei; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",

We studied the cholinergic innervation of the human hippocampal formation by means of immunohistochemistry with polyclonal antisera directed against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), and the low-affinity (p75) nerve growth factor receptor (NGFR). The density of ChAT-like immunoreactive (ChAT-li) fibers differed substantially among the various regions, in general paralleling the pattern of AChE-li staining. One notable exception was the presence of AChE-li cell bodies. In contrast, ChAT immunoreactivity was associated only with fibers and terminals. NGFR-li staining corresponded closely to the ChAT-li fiber pattern. ChAT-li fibers in the CA fields diffusely filled the stratum pyramidale and extended into the stratum oriens and radiatum as well. The highest density was consistently observed in CA4 and CA3 subfields. Staining decreased from CA4 to CA1 and was substantially less dense in the subicular complex. In the entorhinal cortex, the ChAT- and NGFR-li fiber innervation displayed a laminar pattern, most intense over the nests of cells in layer II. There was a trend towards an age-related reduction in the density of ChAT- and AChE-li fibers and terminals.

In the basal forebrain of both primates, a granular NGF-like immunoreactive (ir) reaction product was observed within neurons of the medial septum, nucleus of the diagonal band, and nucleus basalis of Meynert. NGF-like immunoreactivity exclusively colocalized within p75 NGF receptor (NGFR) containing basal forebrain neurons. The intensity of NGF immunolabeling varied between cell bodies. Many NGF-ir perikarya were highly immunoreactive. In other basal forebrain neurons, NGF-like immunoreactivity was either undetectable or minimally expressed. In the hippocampus of both species, NGF-like immunoreactivity was mainly localized within the hilus of the dentate gyrus and within CA3 and CA2 hippocampal subfields. A marked diminution in NGF-like staining was seen in CA1. Within the hippocampal formation, NGF-like immunoreactivity was heaviest within the neuropil of stratum radiatum, intermediate in stratum oriens, and lightest in stratum pyramidal. NGF-like immunoreactivity was not found within the granule or pyramidal cells of the dentate gyrus and hippocampal formation, respectively. These findings demonstrate the presence of an NGF-like antigen in association with monkey and human magnocellular basal forebrain neurons and within their hippocampal target sites.

NADPH-d staining revealed pleomorphic cells, fibers, and blood vessels. Within the entorhinal and the perirhinal cortices, darkly stained (type 1) NADPH-d pyramidal, fusiform, bipolar, and multipolar neurons with extensive dendrites were scattered mainly within deep layers and subjacent white matter. Moderately stained (type 2) NADPH-d round or oval neurons were seen mainly in layers II and III of the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, in the dentate gyrus polymorphic layer, in the CA fields stratum pyramidal and radiatum, and in the subicular complex. The distribution of type 2 cells was more abundant in the perirhinal cortex compared to the hippocampal formation. Lightly stained (type 3) NADPH-d pyramidal and oval neurons were distributed in CA4, the entorhinal cortex medial subfields, and the amygdalohippocampal transition area. Sections concurrently stained for NADPH-d and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) revealed that all type 1 neurons coexpressed NOS, whereas types 2 and 3 were NOS immunonegative. NADPH-d fibers were heterogeneously distributed within the different regions examined and were frequently in close apposition to reactive blood vessels. The greatest concentration of fibers was in layers III and V-VI of the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices, dentate gyrus polymorphic and molecular layers, and CA1 and CA4. A band of fibers coursing within CA1 divided into dorsal and ventral bundles to reach the presubiculum and entorhinal cortex, respectively.

Information regarding all injuries occurring within the previous 6 months was obtained through a structured interview of a caregiver. RESULTS: The rate of injuries was 58.4 per 100 persons per year. Although falling was the single most common mechanism by which injuries occurred, it accounted for only 43.8% of all injuries. Fractures accounted for 13.7% of injuries. Medical treatment was sought for 52.1% of the injuries.

The mechanism by which only select populations of neurons develop these lesions as well as the relationship between them is unknown. To address these questions, we have turned to AD tissue to search for enzymes specifically involved in tau hyperphosphorylation. Recently, we showed that the principal phosphotransferases associated with AD brain-derived tau filaments are members of the casein kinase-1 (CK1) family of protein kinases. Here we report the distribution of three CK1 isoforms (Ckialpha, Ckidelta, and Ckiepsilon) in AD and control brains using immunohistochemistry and Western analysis. In addition to colocalizing with elements of the fibrillar pathology, CK1 is found within the matrix of granulovacuolar degeneration bodies. Furthermore, levels of all CK1 isoforms are elevated in the CA1 region of AD hippocampus relative to controls, with one isoform, Ckidelta, being elevated >30-fold.

This implies that such mutations are either a molecular biomarker of senescence or that they are more causally linked to senescence itself. One assay that can be used to detect these mtDNA mutations is the long-extension polymerase chain reaction assay. This assay amplifies approximately 16 kb of the mtDNA in mammalian mitochondria and preferentially amplifies mtDNAs that are either deleted or duplicated. We have applied this assay to the aging human brain and found a heterogeneous array of rearranged mtDNAs. In addition, we have developed in situ polymerase chain reaction to detect mtDNA within individual cells of both the mouse and the human brain as a first step in identifying and enumerating cells containing mutant mtDNAs in situ.",21/06/2005,565-571,Neurobiol Aging,PubMed,PMID: 10638530,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10638530,"Aged; Female; Humans; Animals; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Mitochondria; Mice; DNA Primers; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Aging; DNA, Mitochondrial; Oxidative Stress; Frontal Lobe; Energy Metabolism; Gene Deletion; Cerebellum; Gene Rearrangement; Mitochondrial ADP, ATP Translocases; Superoxide Dismutase; Superoxides",

To examine the relationship of beta-amyloid deposition to MCI, EC tissue immunostained for this protein was quantitated from a cohort of aged Catholic religious clergy with a clinical diagnosis of MCI and compared to those with no cognitive impairment (NCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). beta-amyloid staining was seen in 12 of the 20 NCI, in 10 of 12 MCI, and in all 12 AD cases within the EC. beta-amyloid immunoreactivity displayed two patterns within the EC: (1) a crescent-shaped band within layers 3-4 or (2) bilaminar staining mainly within layers 2-3 and 5-6. Ten cases failed to display any detectable beta-amyloid imunoreactivity. Despite the heterogeneity of beta-amyloid loads within the clinical groups, decomposing an analysis of variance revealed a significant difference across groups in mean beta-amyloid load within the EC based upon a linear trend analysis. Multiple comparisons testing revealed that NCI individuals had a significantly lower mean beta-amyloid load (1.32) than AD individuals (4.55). The MCI individuals had a mean intermediate (2.60) load between NCI and AD, but not statistically distinguishable from the mean for either NCI or AD. Spearman rank correlation showed a trend for decreasing MMSE with increasing amyloid load that failed to reach statistical significance.

RESULTS: In logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, education, and race there was no association between blood pressure measured as a continuous variable and Alzheimer's disease.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: From 1995 to 1999, we administered four tests of cognitive function (Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status [TICS], immediate and delayed recall of the East Boston Memory Test, and verbal fluency) by telephone to 2,374 participants (70-78 years of age) of the Nurses' Health Study. Information on diabetes was collected biennially beginning in 1976; 82 women reported type 2 diabetes before their cognitive testing. We used linear and logistic regression models to calculate multivariate-adjusted mean differences in scores and relative risks of a low score (bottom 10% of the distribution) for diabetic women compared with nondiabetic women. RESULTS: After multivariate adjustment, women with type 2 diabetes scored lower on all our cognitive tests than women without diabetes. On the general test of cognition (TICS), the mean difference in score between women with and without diabetes was -0.60 (95% CI -1.18 to -0.03, P = 0.04) and the relative risk of a low TICS score was 1.98 (95% CI 1.06 to 3.69). On a global score combining results of the four tests, the mean for diabetic women was lower than that among women without diabetes (adjusted difference in score -0.73, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.04, P = 0.04), and the relative risk of a low global score was 2.16 (95% CI 1.10 to 4.21). Relative to women without diabetes, longer duration of diabetes was associated with lower scores. Few diabetic women were pharmacologically treated (n = 31), but those taking medication had scores similar to those of women without diabetes.

Several lines of evidence suggest that GAL may play a critical role in cognitive processes such as memory and attention through an inhibitory modulation of cholinergic basal forebrain activity. Furthermore, GAL fibers hyperinnervate remaining cholinergic basal forebrain neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This suggests that GAL activity impacts cholinergic dysfunction in advanced AD. Pharmacological and in vitro autoradiographic studies indicate the presence of heterogeneous populations of GAL receptor (GALR) sites in the basal forebrain which bind GAL with both high and low affinity. Interestingly, we have recently observed that GALR binding sites increase in the anterior basal forebrain in late-stage AD. Three G protein-coupled GALRs have been identified to date that signal through a diverse array of effector pathways in vitro, including adenylyl cyclase inhibition and phospholipase C activation. The repertoire and distribution of GALR expression in the basal forebrain remains unknown, as does the nature of GAL and GALR plasticity in the AD basal forebrain. Recently, GAL knockout and overexpressing transgenic mice have been generated to facilitate our understanding of GAL activity in basal forebrain function. GAL knockout mice result in fewer cholinergic basal forebrain neurons and memory deficits. On the other hand, mice overexpressing GAL display hyperinnervation of basal forebrain and memory deficits. These data highlight the need to explore further the putative mechanisms by which GAL signaling might be beneficial or deleterious for cholinergic cell survival and activity within basal forebrain.

Growth curve models were used to assess change in each measure and its relation to apoE genotype, controlling for age, sex, education, and baseline level of cognition. Follow up data were available in 669 persons (98% of those eligible). We treated those with the epsilon 3/3 genotype as the reference group (n=425), which was contrasted with epsilon 2 ( epsilon 2/2, epsilon 2/3; n=86), and epsilon 4 ( epsilon 3/4, epsilon 4/4; n=158) subgroups. RESULTS: Rate of episodic memory change in the three subgroups significantly differed, with an average annual increase of 0.016 units in the epsilon 2 subgroup and annual decreases of 0.022 units in those with epsilon 3/3 and of 0.073 units in the epsilon 4 subgroup. The epsilon 2 subgroup did not differ from those with epsilon 3/3 in rate of decline in other cognitive systems. The epsilon 4 subgroup declined more rapidly than those with epsilon 3/3 in semantic memory and perceptual speed but not in working memory or visuospatial ability.

Anti-tau monoclonal antibodies whose epitopes are distributed across much of the molecule were used to probe vulnerable brain regions in 37 clinically staged cases obtained from the Religious Orders Study. In this way, tau conformational changes were evaluated as the disease progressed from early cognitive decline to AD. These analyses revealed three main findings. First, the presence of granulovacuolar and fibrillar lesions correlates with several measures of episodic memory, suggesting that these lesions significantly contribute to cognitive dysfunction. Second, neuropil threads precede the appearance of neurofibrillary tangles that in turn precede the appearance of neuritic plaques. Third, tau structural changes, or ""conformational signatures,"" emerged as a result of in situ reactivity to a subset of antibodies and nonreactivity to others, thereby reflecting the underlying status of the tau molecule within the fibrillar lesions. These signatures allowed us to document a sequence of tau conformational changes that occur during AD and to correlate these changes with episodic memory deficits.

Few large longitudinal studies have compared the natural history of mild cognitive impairment with similar persons without cognitive impairment. METHODS: Participants were older Catholic clergy without dementia, 211 with mild cognitive impairment and 587 without cognitive impairment, who underwent annual clinical evaluation for AD and an assessment of different cognitive abilities. Cognitive performance tests were summarized to yield a composite measure of global cognitive function and separate summary measures of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability. The authors compared the risk of death, risk of incident AD, and rates of change in global cognition and different cognitive domains among persons with mild cognitive impairment to those without cognitive impairment. All models controlled for age, sex, and education. RESULTS: On average, persons with mild cognitive impairment had significantly lower scores at baseline in all cognitive domains.

In this regard, changes in some cholinergic basal forebrain (CBF) markers (e.g. the high affinity trkA receptor) but not others (e.g., cortical choline acetyltransferase [ChAT] activity, the number of ChAT and vesicular acetylcholine transporter-immunoreactive neurons) suggest specific phenotypic changes, but not frank neuronal degeneration, early in the disease process. The present study examined the expression of the low affinity p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)), an excellent marker of CBF neurons, in postmortem tissue derived from clinically well-characterized individuals who have been classified as having no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and mild AD.

The number of p75(NTR)-immunoreactive nucleus basalis neurons was significantly correlated with performance on the Mini-Mental State Exam, a Global Cognitive Test score, as well as some individual tests of working memory and attention. These data, together with previous reports, support the concept that phenotypic changes, but not frank neuronal degeneration, occur early in cognitive decline.

However, the extent to which reductions in ChAT activity are associated with early cognitive decline has not been well established. We quantified ChAT activity in the hippocampus and four cortical regions (superior frontal, inferior parietal, superior temporal, and anterior cingulate) of 58 individuals diagnosed with no cognitive impairment (NCI; n = 26; mean age 81.4 +/- 7.3 years), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 18; mean age 84.5 +/- 5.7), or mild AD (n =14; mean age 86.3 +/- 6.6). Inferior parietal cortex ChAT activity was also assessed in 12 subjects with end-stage AD (mean age 81.4 +/- 4.3 years) and compared to inferior parietal cortex ChAT levels of the other three groups. Only the end-stage AD group had ChAT levels reduced below normal. In individuals with MCI and mild AD, ChAT activity was unchanged in the inferior parietal, superior temporal, and anterior cingulate cortices compared to NCI. In contrast, ChAT activity in the superior frontal cortex was significantly elevated above normal controls in MCI subjects, whereas the mild AD group was not different from NCI or MCI. Hippocampal ChAT activity was significantly higher in MCI subjects than in either NCI or AD. Our results suggest that cognitive deficits in MCI and early AD are not associated with the loss of ChAT and occur despite regionally specific upregulation. Thus, the earliest cognitive deficits in AD involve brain changes other than simply cholinergic system loss. Of importance, the cholinergic system is capable of compensatory responses during the early stage of dementia.

CBF neurons provide the major cholinergic innervation to the hippocampus, amygdala and neocortex. They play a role in cognition and attentional behaviors, and are dysfunctional in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The human CBF displays a continuum of large cells that contain various cholinergic markers, nerve growth factor (NGF) and its cognate receptors, calbindin, glutamate receptors, and the estrogen receptors, ERalpha and ERbeta. Admixed with these cholinergic neuronal phenotypes are smaller interneurons containing the m2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChRs), NADPH-diaphorase, GABA, calcium binding proteins and several inhibitory neuropeptides including galanin (GAL), which is over expressed in AD. Studies using human autopsy material indicate an age-related dissociation of calbindin and the glutamate receptor GluR2 within CBF neurons, suggesting that these molecules act synergistically to induce excitotoxic cell death during aging, and possibly during AD. Choline acetyltrasnferease (ChAT) activity and CBF neuron number is preserved in the cholinergic basocortical system and up regulated in the septohippocampal system during prodromal as compared with end stage AD. In contrast, the number of CBF neurons containing NGF receptors is reduced early in the disease process suggesting a phenotypic silence and not a frank loss of neurons. In end stage AD, there is a selective reduction in trkA mRNA but not p75(NTR) in single CBF cells suggesting a neurotrophic defect throughout the progression of AD.

METHODS: A total of 130 older Catholic clergy participating in the Religious Orders Study underwent annual cognitive function testing and brain autopsy at the time of death. Individual cognitive function tests were z-scored and averaged to yield a global measure of cognitive function and summary measures of five different cognitive abilities. Neuritic and diffuse plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were counted in separate 1 mm(2) areas of maximal density. Counts were converted to standard scores by dividing by their SD, and combined to yield a global AD pathology score and summary scores of each postmortem index. Linear regression was used to examine the relation of education and AD pathology scores to level of cognitive function proximate to death, controlling for age and sex. Subsequent analyses tested the interaction between education and each AD pathology score to determine whether education modified the relation of AD pathology to level of cognitive function. Additional analyses examined these associations on five specific cognitive abilities. RESULTS: Both years of formal education (regression coefficient = 0.073, p = 0.0001) and the global AD pathology score (regression coefficient = -0.689, p < 0.0001) were related to level of cognitive function. When an interaction term between education and AD pathology was added to the model, the association between a unit of AD pathology and level of cognitive function was 0.088 (p = 0.0078) standard unit less for each year of education than the level predicted from the model without the interaction term. Whereas neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles were all strongly related to cognitive function, education only modified the relation of neuritic plaques (p = 0.002) and diffuse plaques (p = 0.03) to cognition, but not neurofibrillary tangles.

We correlated levels of hippocampal choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity with the extent of AD lesions in subjects from the Religious Order Study, including cases with no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI, and with mild to moderate AD. Hippocampal ChAT activity levels were also determined in a group of end-stage AD patients who were enrolled in the University of Pittsburgh Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. MCI subjects were characterized with increased hippocampal ChAT activity. This elevation was no longer present in mild AD cases, which were not different from NCI subjects. Severe AD cases showed markedly depleted hippocampal ChAT levels. In NCI, MCI, and mild-moderate AD, there was a positive correlation between hippocampal ChAT activity levels and progression of neuritic plaque pathology in entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. A significant elevation of hippocampal ChAT in the MCI group was found selectively in the limbic (i.e., entorhinal-hippocampal, III/IV) Braak stages. We hypothesize that cholinergic changes in the hippocampus of MCI subjects reflect a compensatory response to the progressive denervation of the hippocampus by lost entorhinal cortex input. Moreover, the present findings suggest that the short-term memory loss observed in MCI is not caused by cholinergic deficits; it more likely relates to disrupted entorhinal-hippocampal connectivity.",2003-02,39-48,J Alzheimers Dis,PubMed,PMID: 12590165,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12590165,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Neurons; Neuropsychological Tests; Hippocampus; Cognition Disorders; Severity of Illness Index; Entorhinal Cortex; Neuronal Plasticity; Choline O-Acetyltransferase",

We measured the association between parkinsonism and subsequent disability. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, longitudinal, community-based population study in East Boston, Massachusetts, using a stratified random sample of 455 community residents, aged 65 years and older. Four categories of parkinsonian signs were measured at baseline: bradykinesia, gait disturbance, rigidity, and tremor. Parkinsonism was defined as the presence of two or more categories of parkinsonian signs, and cases of Parkinson's disease were excluded from analyses. Disability was assessed annually over a mean of 4.7 years using the Katz, Rosow-Breslau, and Nagi disability measures. RESULTS: Parkinsonism at baseline strongly predicted subsequent disability as assessed with the three disability measures (on the Katz measure, beta = -1.30, p < .001). On average, a person with parkinsonism had a disability level at follow-up equal to that of a comparable person approximately 16.7 years for men and 8 years for women. The rate of developing disability for persons with parkinsonism increased each year; on the Katz measure, participants with parkinsonism declined on average 16.4% faster than those without. Gait impairment and bradykinesia strongly predicted subsequent disability; tremor and rigidity did not.

To determine whether this increase in proNGF is an early or late change during the progression of cognitive decline, we used Western blotting to measure the relative amounts of proNGF protein in the parietal cortex from subjects clinically classified with no cognitive impairment (NCI; n = 20), mild cognitive impairment (MCI; n = 20), or mild to moderate AD (n = 19). We found that proNGF increased during the prodromal stage of AD.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether the level of depressive symptoms predicted the rate of cognitive decline in a biracial community of older persons. METHODS: 4392 older people (88% of those eligible) from a defined community in Chicago completed two or three structured interviews at approximately three year intervals for an average of 5.3 years. At the baseline interview, the number of depressive symptoms was assessed with a 10 item version of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale. Cognitive function was assessed at each interview with four performance tests, from which a previously established measure of global cognition was derived. Random effects models were used to assess change in cognition and its relation to depressive symptoms, controlling for age, sex, race, education, and baseline cognitive function. RESULTS: Participants reported a median of one depressive symptom at baseline (interquartile range, 0 to 2). For each depressive symptom, the rate of cognitive decline increased by a mean of about 5%. Results were not substantially changed when persons with cognitive impairment at baseline were excluded, or when chronic illness or participation in cognitively stimulating activities was controlled, and the association was not modified by age, sex, race, or education.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the extent to which MCI is associated with parkinsonian signs and the relation between cognitive abilities and parkinsonism among individuals with MCI. METHODS: Participants included 835 individuals from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a clinical-pathologic study of common chronic conditions of old age. All participants underwent detailed clinical evaluations which included assessments of parkinsonian signs and cognitive function, and linear regression models were used to examine the associations of MCI and parkinsonism. RESULTS: In a series of analyses controlled for age, sex, and education, individuals with MCI exhibited significantly more parkinsonism than individuals without cognitive impairment, particularly gait disturbance, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Among individuals with MCI, lower levels of cognitive function, particularly in perceptual speed, were associated with higher levels of parkinsonism; when classified according to MCI subtype, individuals with amnestic vs non-amnestic MCI differed from each other on only one parkinsonian sign, with non-amnestic MCI showing more gait disturbance. Because vascular factors can contribute to cognitive impairment and parkinsonian signs, the authors repeated the core analyses including terms for vascular risk factors and vascular disease and the associations between MCI and parkinsonism persisted.

We combined a suite of methods and technologies, including novel sample preparation based on carrier-protein capture and biomarker enrichment, high-resolution mass spectrometry, a unique cohort of well-characterized persons with and without Alzheimer disease (AD), and powerful bioinformatic analysis, that add statistical and procedural robustness to biomarker discovery from blood. METHODS: Carrier-protein-bound peptides were isolated from serum samples by affinity chromatography, and peptide mass spectra were acquired by a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) orthogonal time-of-flight (O-TOF) mass spectrometer capable of collecting data over a broad mass range (100 to >300,000 Da) in a single acquisition. Discriminatory analysis of mass spectra was used to process and analyze the raw mass spectral data. RESULTS: Coupled with the biomarker enrichment protocol, the high-resolution MALDI O-TOF mass spectra provided informative, reproducible peptide signatures. The raw mass spectra were analyzed and used to build discriminant disease models that were challenged with blinded samples for classification.

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that amyloid load can account for (mediate) the association of the APOE e4 allele with level of cognition assessed proximate to death. METHODS: There were 44 subjects with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and 50 without dementia, who had participated in the Religious Orders Study. They underwent determination of APOE allele status, had comprehensive cognitive testing in the last year of life, and brain autopsy at death. The percentage area of cortex occupied by amyloid beta and the density of tau positive neurofibrillary tangles were quantified from six brain regions and averaged to yield summary measures of amyloid load and neurofibrillary tangles. Multiple regression analyses were used to examine whether amyloid load could account for the effect of allele status on level of cognition, controlling for age, sex, and education. RESULTS: Possession of at least one APOE e4 allele was associated with lower level of cognitive function proximate to death (p = 0.04).

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that these neuropathological features are related to implicit memory--measured by repetition priming--in a test that emphasized conceptual (or meaning-based) cognitive processing, and that the pathological changes are not related to implicit memory in a repetition priming test that emphasized perceptual (or sensory-based) cognitive processing. Subjects were older nuns, priests and brothers participating in the Religious Orders Study who agreed to annual neurological and neuropsychological evaluation for Alzheimer's disease and common neurological conditions of ageing, and brain autopsy at time of death. Explicit memory was measured by seven tests of episodic recall and recognition and converted to a previously established summary measure. Implicit memory was measured by four repetition priming tests. One test, category exemplar priming, emphasized conceptual, or meaning-based cognitive processing. A second test, word-identification priming, emphasized perceptual, or sensory-based cognitive processing. Two additional priming tests, picture-naming and word-stem completion, invoke both conceptual and perceptual processes.

METHODS: The authors used proportional odds models to assess the relationship between entorhinal and hippocampal size and risk of incident AD among 58 nondemented elderly people. All participants were followed with annual clinical evaluations and structural MRI scans for up to 5 years (baseline and 5 years of follow-up). At baseline, 23 of 58 participants received a diagnosis of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 35 of 58 were healthy control subjects with no cognitive impairment. Structural MRI scans were acquired with a T1-weighted three-dimensional spoiled gradient-recalled echo pulse sequence in a 1.5 T scanner. Entorhinal and hippocampal volumes were derived from 1.6-mm gapless coronal images reformatted to be perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus and were normalized by dividing with intracranial volume. RESULTS: Fourteen of 58 nondemented participants developed AD during the follow-up period. Initial diagnosis of MCI was a significant predictor of incident AD. In addition, both baseline entorhinal volume and its slope of decline were independent predictors of incident AD, but initial hippocampal size and its rate of decline were not, after controlling for entorhinal volume.

OBJECTIVE: To test whether the relation of AD pathology to the clinical manifestations of the disease differs in men and women. DESIGN: Longitudinal, clinicopathologic cohort study. PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: Analyses were conducted on 141 older Catholic clergy members who underwent detailed annual clinical evaluations and brain autopsy at death. The number of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles in a 1-mm2 area sampled from 4 cortical regions was counted, and a global measure of AD pathology (range, 0-2.98 U) and specific measures of each pathology were derived.

There are two forms of BDNF, the BDNF precursor (proBDNF) and mature BDNF, in human brain. Previous studies have shown that BDNF mRNA and protein, including proBDNF, are dramatically decreased in end-stage AD brain. To determine whether this BDNF decrease is an early or late event during the progression of cognitive decline, we used western blotting to measure the relative amounts of BDNF proteins in the parietal cortex of subjects clinically classified with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild to moderate AD. We found that the amount of proBDNF decreased 21 and 30% in MCI and AD groups, respectively, as compared with NCI, consistent with our previous results of a 40% decrease in end-stage AD. Mature BDNF was reduced 34 and 62% in MCI and AD groups, respectively. Thus, the decrease in mature BDNF and proBDNF precedes the decline in choline acetyltransferase activity which occurs later in AD. Both proBDNF and mature BDNF levels were positively correlated with cognitive measures such as the Global Cognitive Score and the Mini Mental State Examination score. These results demonstrate that the reduction of both forms of BDNF occurs early in the course of AD and correlates with loss of cognitive function, suggesting that proBDNF and BDNF play a role in synaptic loss and cellular dysfunction underlying cognitive impairment in AD.",2005-06,1412-1421,J Neurochem,PubMed,PMID: 15935057,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15935057,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Biomarkers; Down-Regulation; Alzheimer Disease; Disease Progression; Neurons; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognition Disorders; Nerve Degeneration; Parietal Lobe; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Cell Survival; Protein Precursors; Cell Death",

Surprisingly, the number of choline acetyltransferase-containing neurons remains stable despite a significant reduction in NGF receptor-positive cells in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), suggesting a phenotypic NGF receptor downregulation but not a frank loss of NB neurons during prodromal AD. Moreover, there is a loss of cortical TrkA in the face of stable p75NTR and increased proNGF levels, the precursor molecule of mature NGF, in early AD.

EDS is also very common in Parkinson's disease (PD), regardless of disease severity. The purpose of this study was to determine whether more Parkinsonian motor signs exist in AD patients with more reported daytime napping compared to AD patients without daytime napping. PATIENTS AND METHODS: AD patients ((National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association) NINCDS/ADRDA criteria) were prospectively evaluated in a dementia clinic. Parkinsonian motor signs were assessed using a modified motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (mmUPDRS). AD patients were grouped according to daytime napping frequency: (1) minimal napping (AD-Naps), or (2) napping at least once a day (AD+Naps). Wilcoxon rank-sum tests and chi2-tests computed differences between groups for mmUPDRS, nighttime sleep disturbances, and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). Statistical significance was set at P<0.05. RESULTS: AD patients were classified as AD-Naps (n=155) or AD+Naps (n=180).

To determine whether this neurotransmitter-specific progression persists at later pathological stages, presynaptic bouton densities, and the areas of occupation and localization of plaque adjacent dystrophic neurites were quantified in 18-month-old APP(K670N, M671L)+PS1(M146L) doubly transgenic mice. Quantification revealed that transgenic animals had significantly lower cholinergic, glutamatergic and GABAergic presynaptic bouton densities. Cholinergic and glutamatergic dystrophic neurites appear to be heavily influenced by fibrillar Abeta as both types displayed a decreasing area of occupation with respect to increasing plaque size. Furthermore, cholinergic dystrophic neurites reside in closer proximity to plaques than glutamatergic dystrophic neurites, while GABAergic dystrophic neurites were minimal regardless of plaque size. To investigate whether similarities exist in the human AD pathology, a monoclonal antibody (McKA1) against the human vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) was developed.

The Resource Use Inventory (RUI) is an instrument that has been used to capture resource utilization and costs in populations with Alzheimer disease (AD). However, resource utilization and costs for healthy, cognitively intact elderly as they begin to demonstrate cognitive deterioration are not well understood. In addition, the loss that relates to the subjects' own time as they transition through cognitive impairment is not well documented. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the utility of the RUI in a sample of cognitively intact elderly individuals living in the community and enrolled in AD prevention trials. METHODS: The RUI was administered to 644 subjects and their study partners either at home or in the clinic. For half of each sample, 3-month retesting was carried out. The RUI consisted of 9 questions. The first part of the RUI captured subjects' use of direct medical care (eg, hospitalizations) and nonmedical care (eg, home health aides). The second part of the RUI captured the time caregivers spend providing care to the subjects. The third part of the RUI captured subjects' participation in volunteer work and employment. The assessment interval for each question was the past 3 months. RESULTS: The percentage of RUI forms returned incomplete or inaccurate for both in-clinic and at-home groups was extremely low. There were no differences in utilization rates between in-clinic and at-home group for all items in the RUI. Except for use of outpatient procedures, tests, or treatments, there were no differences in utilization rates between subjects who filled out the RUI with the help of their study partners or by themselves. Items in the RUI were sensitive to subjects' cognitive and functional status and demographic characteristics.

The ADCS Instrument Committee has previously helped to define the state of the art in assessment for AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment clinical trials. We are now entering an exciting era of primary prevention trials to evaluate promising treatments that may delay disease onset and there is a need to develop appropriate instruments for these trials. The ADCS instrument committee has undertaken a project to develop instruments for prevention studies that assess domains known to be important in AD. Prevention trials are long and require large numbers of subjects, making them costly and requiring a high burden of participation for subjects. The current study focused on developing instruments that can be completed at home and in the clinic. The instruments are being evaluated in a cohort of nondemented elderly participating in a 4-year longitudinal study that simulates the design of a primary prevention trial. This report describes the design, baseline characteristics, and some longitudinal outcomes of the study cohort through the completion of the first 2 years of follow-up. We also describe the assessment domains to be measured with our new experimental instruments. This study recruited 644 subjects, 75 years of age and older. Participation in a ""book club"" that provided free books of interest to elders was offered as a recruitment incentive. Approximately 23% had some mild cognitive symptoms consistent with a Clinical Dementia Rating of 0.5. All subjects received a standardized in-clinic evaluation at baseline, which is repeated annually for 4 years to identify cases suspected of developing dementia and to measure longitudinal change on established clinical assessments. Subjects completed a set of self-administered experimental instruments at home or in the clinic designed to assess cognitive function and behavior, global change, activities of daily living, quality of life, and resource use. An additional ""mail-in cognitive function questionnaire"" was obtained separately by mail, 1 month before the other assessments. To evaluate the feasibility, efficiency, and validity of the home-based instruments in comparison with acquiring the same information during a clinic visit, subjects were randomized to 1 of 2 conditions in which the baseline and annual follow-up assessments are completed either at home (""home group"") or at the study site during their clinic visits (""clinic group"").

An unbiased stereologic sampling scheme coupled with transmission electron microscopy to directly visualize synaptic contacts, was used to estimate the total number of synapses in short postmortem autopsy tissue. Individuals with eAD had significantly fewer synapses than the other two diagnostic groups. Seventy-five percent of the individuals with MCI had synaptic values that were lower than the NCI group mean. The number of synapses showed a significant correlation with the subject's Mini-Mental State score and with cognitive tests involving delayed recall. Synaptic loss showed no relationship to Braak stage or to apoE genotype. The volume of the OML was significantly reduced in eAD compared to the other two diagnositic groups that were not different from each other. These data suggest that a loss of afferents from the entorhinal cortex underlie the synapse loss seen in eAD.

The MCFSI consists of 2 similar sets of 14 questions mailed separately to the subject and the study partner, who are asked to complete them independently. The questions are derived from a standard clinical assessment of dementia; they ask about decline in function over the last year.

In some cases, this activation may play a role in NO-mediated degeneration of pyramidal neurons. In this report, we explore the anatomy of various classes of cortical nNOS (+) (nitrergic) neurons, with emphasis on small interneurons, in the medial temporal lobe of subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) from two well-characterized cohorts, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study on Aging (BLSA) and the Religious Order Study (ROS). We find that small calbindin (+) cortical interneurons are induced to high levels of NADPHd/nNOS reactivity early in AD and abound in areas with emerging neurofibrillary pathology, that is, in entorhinal cortex in the beginning of the limbic stage of Braak, in hippocampal CA1 in the mature limbic stage and in temporal neocortex in the late limbic stage. This pattern was robust and significant in the younger of the two AD cohorts studied (BLSA), but persisted as a trend in the older cohort (ROS). In optimally prepared material, we find a significant correlation between numbers of these interneurons and markers of neuronal cell death, for example, caspase-3 activation. Our results show that small cortical inhibitory interneurons represent an extensive signaling system that is induced to higher levels of NADPHd/nNOS expression early in the paralimbic-limbic-neocortical sequence of AD progression. We propose that nNOS/NO signaling initiated in these interneurons can serve as a marker of early cortical injury in AD.

The purpose of this study was to examine the association of blood pressure (BP) with change in lower limb function in older persons. METHODS: Eight hundred eighty-eight older Catholic clergy members without baseline dementia or Parkinson's disease were recruited from about 40 groups across the United States. At baseline, BP was measured, the presence of vascular diseases and diabetes was recorded, cognitive function was assessed, and medications were inspected. At baseline and subsequent annual visits, gait and balance were assessed using performance-based tasks from which a previously established composite measure of lower limb function was derived. RESULTS: In a general estimating equation analysis controlling for age, education, and gender, a 10 mmHg increment in systolic blood pressure (SBP) was associated with greater decline in lower limb function (estimate of interaction = -6.35 x 10(-3), standard error = 2.49 x 10(-3), p =.011). Thus, on average, lower limb function declined 28.7% faster in persons with an SBP of 160 mmHg than in persons with an SBP of 120 mmHg. This effect was unchanged after controlling for baseline vascular diseases, diabetes, or cognition. However, censoring individuals who developed stroke during the study made the relationship between SBP and change in lower limb function nonsignificant.

The former is composed of hyperphosphorylated aggregates of the microtubule-associated protein tau. The latter is poorly characterized but reacts strongly with anti-phosphoepitope antibodies indicating that it too accumulates phosphoproteins. Both lesions react strongly with antibodies directed against members of the casein kinase-1 family of phosphotransferases, a group of closely related protein kinases that frequently function in tandem with the ubiquitin modification system. To determine whether individual members of the casein kinase-1 family differentially associate with AD lesions, hippocampal sections isolated from late stage cases of AD were subjected to double-label fluorescence immunohistochemistry using a panel of selective anti-casein kinase 1 antibodies and small-molecule fluorochromes thioflavin S and thiazin red. The resultant colocalization patterns revealed that the alpha CK1 isoform strongly correlated with thioflavin S and thiazin red fluorescence, indicating that it preferentially associated with neurofibrillary lesions. In contrast, the delta isoform staining pattern was dominated by colocalization with granulovacuolar degeneration bodies. These findings suggest that granulovacuolar and neurofibrillary lesions occupy separate populations of neurons, and implicate CK1 isoforms in the generation of lesion-associated phosphoepitopes. They also suggest a nexus between the phosphorylation and ubiquitination modifications found in both lesions.",2006-05,413-421,Acta Neuropathol,PubMed,PMID: 16557393,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16557393,"Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Isoenzymes; Alzheimer Disease; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Hippocampus; Nerve Degeneration; Immunohistochemistry; Peptidylprolyl Isomerase; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase; Antibody Specificity; Casein Kinase I; Vacuoles",

Survival of CBF neurons depends upon binding of nerve growth factor (NGF) with high-affinity (trkA) and low-affinity (p75(NTR)) neurotrophin receptors produced within CBF neurons. Since trkA and p75(NTR) protein levels are reduced within CBF neurons of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD, trkA and/or p75(NTR) gene expression deficits may drive NB degeneration. Using single cell expression profiling methods coupled with custom-designed cDNA arrays and validation with real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and in situ hybridization, individual cholinergic NB neurons displayed a significant down regulation of trkA, trkB, and trkC expression during the progression of AD. An intermediate reduction was observed in MCI, with the greatest decrement in mild to moderate AD as compared to controls. Importantly, trk down regulation is associated with cognitive decline measured by the Global Cognitive Score (GCS) and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

Reduced expression of LR11, as occurs in the brains of individuals with Alzheimer's disease (AD), increases amyloidogenesis, and variants in the gene that encodes LR11, SORL1, have recently been linked to risk for late-onset AD. In this study, we sought to determine whether reduced expression of LR11 occurs early in the disease process and whether protein levels in cortical neurons are associated with clinical and pathological changes in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition that may represent prodromal AD. METHODS: A novel quantitative immunohistochemical approach was used to measure LR11 levels in brain tissue collected from subjects diagnosed antemortem with either no cognitive impairment, MCI, or AD from the Rush University Religious Orders Study. RESULTS: LR11 levels in MCI were intermediate between no cognitive impairment and AD. LR11 expression was heterogeneous in MCI, forming low- and high-level LR11 subgroups. MCI subjects with low LR11 were significantly more cognitively impaired than the high LR11 subjects. We also found a significant correlation between cognitive performance and LR11 levels across all clinical groups examined. There was no association between LR11 and plaque and tangle pathology.

Nucleus basalis neurons receive cholinergic inputs and express nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and muscarinic AChRs (mAChRs), which may regulate NB neuron activity in AD. Although alterations in these AChRs occur in the AD cortex, there is little information detailing whether defects in nAChR and mAChR gene expression occur in cholinergic NB neurons during disease progression. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether nAChR and mAChR gene expression is altered in cholinergic NB neurons during the progression of AD. DESIGN: Individual NB neurons from subjects diagnosed ante mortem as having no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or mild to moderate AD were analyzed by single-cell AChR expression profiling via custom-designed microarrays. SETTING: Academic research. PARTICIPANTS: Participants were members of the Rush Religious Orders Study cohort. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to validate microarray findings. RESULTS: Cholinergic NB neurons displayed a statistically significant up-regulation of alpha7 nAChR messenger RNA expression in subjects with mild to moderate AD compared with those with NCI and MCI (P<.001). No differences were found for other nAChR and mAChR subtypes across the cohort. Expression levels of alpha7 nAChRs were inversely associated with Global Cognitive Score and with Mini-Mental State Examination performance. CONCLUSIONS: Up-regulation of alpha7 nAChRs may signal a compensatory response to maintain basocortical cholinergic activity during AD progression. Alternatively, putative competitive interactions of this receptor with beta-amyloid may provide a pathogenic mechanism for NB dysfunction.

In general, ChAT activity levels are stable in the neocortex in mild to moderate AD (mAD) and there is a selective up-regulation in the superior frontal cortex (SFC) in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), indicating a transient, region-specific cholinergic neuroplastic response. OBJECTIVE: To assess whether a proliferation of cholinergic axons underlies increased ChAT activity levels in the SFC in subjects with MCI. DESIGN: Stereologic principles were applied to assess the density of ChAT-immunoreactive fibers and axon varicosities in SFC tissue obtained postmortem from subjects with no cognitive impairment, MCI, and mAD. SUBJECTS: Thirty-six subjects enrolled in the Religious Orders Study, with records of annual clinical evaluation for frontal lobe specific and global cognitive functions. RESULTS: Compared with the group with no cognitive impairment, SFC ChAT-immunoreactive fiber and axon varicosity densities were not altered in the MCI group but were significantly reduced in the group with mAD and correlated with impaired frontal lobe and global cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of an increase in cholinergic axonal innervation of the SFC in MCI suggests that structural reorganization of cholinergic profiles is not the mechanism underlying the transient cholinergic plasticity reported in this region. Furthermore, the stability of cholinergic enzyme activity in mAD is likely the result of a biochemical up-regulation of ChAT protein or enzyme activity levels in the SFC, compensating for decreased regional cholinergic fibers and axon varicosities.",2007-09,1312-1317,Arch Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 17846271,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17846271,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognition Disorders; Prefrontal Cortex; Immunohistochemistry; Choline O-Acetyltransferase; Parasympathetic Nervous System; Axons; Nerve Fibers,

Recent advances in molecular genetics, biochemistry, and neuropathology of FTLD prompted the Midwest Consortium for Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration and experts at other centers to review and revise the existing neuropathologic diagnostic criteria for FTLD. The proposed criteria for FTLD are based on existing criteria, which include the tauopathies [FTLD with Pick bodies, corticobasal degeneration, progressive supranuclear palsy, sporadic multiple system tauopathy with dementia, argyrophilic grain disease, neurofibrillary tangle dementia, and FTD with microtubule-associated tau (MAPT) gene mutation, also called FTD with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17)]. The proposed criteria take into account new disease entities and include the novel molecular pathology, TDP-43 proteinopathy, now recognized to be the most frequent histological finding in FTLD. TDP-43 is a major component of the pathologic inclusions of most sporadic and familial cases of FTLD with ubiquitin-positive, tau-negative inclusions (FTLD-U) with or without motor neuron disease (MND). Molecular genetic studies of familial cases of FTLD-U have shown that mutations in the progranulin (PGRN) gene are a major genetic cause of FTLD-U. Mutations in valosin-containing protein (VCP) gene are present in rare familial forms of FTD, and some families with FTD and/or MND have been linked to chromosome 9p, and both are types of FTLD-U. Thus, familial TDP-43 proteinopathy is associated with defects in multiple genes, and molecular genetics is required in these cases to correctly identify the causative gene defect. In addition to genetic heterogeneity amongst the TDP-43 proteinopathies, there is also neuropathologic heterogeneity and there is a close relationship between genotype and FTLD-U subtype. In addition to these recent significant advances in the neuropathology of FTLD-U, novel FTLD entities have been further characterized, including neuronal intermediate filament inclusion disease. The proposed criteria incorporate up-to-date neuropathology of FTLD in the light of recent immunohistochemical, biochemical, and genetic advances.

Here we test the hypothesis that chronic psychological distress is associated with increased incidence of MCI in old age. METHODS: Participants are older persons from two cohort studies with uniform annual clinical evaluations which included detailed cognitive testing and clinical classification of MCI. We excluded persons with dementia or MCI at baseline; follow-up data were available on 1,256 persons without cognitive impairment (95% of those eligible). At baseline, they completed a six-item measure of neuroticism (mean = 15.6, SD = 6.6), an indicator of the tendency to experience psychological distress. RESULTS: During up to 12 years of follow-up, 482 persons (38%) developed MCI. Risk of MCI increased by about 2% for each one unit increase on the distress scale (relative risk [RR] = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.04), with the association slightly stronger in men than women. Overall, a distress-prone person (score = 24, 90th percentile) was about 40% more likely to develop MCI than someone not prone to distress (score = 8, 10th percentile). Adjustment for depressive symptomatology at baseline did not substantially change results (RR = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.00, 1.03).

How affected persons function during this potentially difficult transition is not well understood. The aim of this study was to examine the associations of day care use and nursing home placement with the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease. METHOD: The participants were 432 older persons with Alzheimer's disease who were recruited from health care settings in the Chicago area. At baseline, they lived in the community and were using day care services a mean 1.7 days per week. At 6-month intervals for up to 4 years, they completed nine cognitive tests from which a composite measure of global cognition was derived. RESULTS: On average, cognition declined at a gradually increasing rate during the study period. Nursing home placement was associated with a decrease in the level of cognition and an acceleration in the rate of cognitive decline. Day care use at baseline was not related to cognitive decline in initial analyses, but it interacted with nursing home placement such that higher level of day care use substantially reduced association of placement with accelerated cognitive decline. Education interacted with placement such that more schooling was associated with a greater increase in cognitive decline upon nursing home placement, but prior day care use also attenuated this association.

Because AD is a slowly progressive disease with a preclinical period that can last years, the abundance and regulatory function of Pin1 may vary on the course of the disease.

The positive correlation trend in MCI and the robust correlation in AD between Pin1 activity and phosphorylated tau implies that increasing phosphorylated tau during AD pathogenesis may induce the compensatory activation/up-regulation of Pin1, while the inverse correlation between Pin1 activity and phosphorylated tau in NCI group implies that decreased Pin1 may play a role in the initial accumulation of phosphorylated tau in AD pathogenesis.",2007-03,13-23,J Alzheimers Dis,PubMed,PMID: 17361031,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17361031,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; RNA, Messenger; Gene Expression; Microtubules; Down-Regulation; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Neurofibrillary Tangles; tau Proteins; Cognition Disorders; Phosphorylation; Blotting, Western; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Statistics as Topic; Peptidylprolyl Isomerase; NIMA-Interacting Peptidylprolyl Isomerase",

Furthermore, chronic treatment of aged Tg2576 mice with energy inhibitors increases levels of eIF2alpha-P, BACE1, Abeta, and amyloid plaques. Importantly, eIF2alpha-P and BACE1 are elevated in aggressive plaque-forming 5XFAD transgenic mice, and BACE1, eIF2alpha-P, and amyloid load are correlated in humans with AD. These results strongly suggest that eIF2alpha phosphorylation increases BACE1 levels and causes Abeta overproduction, which could be an early, initiating molecular mechanism in sporadic AD.",26/12/2008,988-1009,Neuron,PubMed,PMID: 19109907 PMCID: PMC2667382,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19109907,"Aged, 80 and over; Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Peptide Fragments; Animals; Age Factors; Time Factors; Cells, Cultured; Mice; Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Alzheimer Disease; Plaque, Amyloid; Neurons; Disease Models, Animal; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Mice, Transgenic; Cerebral Cortex; Glucose; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Phosphorylation; Enzyme Activation; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Embryo, Mammalian; Transfection; Antimetabolites; Convulsants; Dactinomycin; Deoxyglucose; eIF-2 Kinase; Nitro Compounds; Propionates; Protein Synthesis Inhibitors",

We used synaptosomal fractionation with Western blotting and immunohistochemistry to examine the anatomical, subcellular, and subsynaptic expression patterns of caspase 3 in both the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus of control and AD patients. In both control and AD cases, there was a selective enrichment of caspase- 3 at synapses, particularly in the postsynaptic density (PSD) fractions. Compared with controls, AD patients exhibited significant increases in synaptic procaspase- 3 and active caspase-3 expression levels that were most evident in the PSD fractions.

Even in the absence of vitamin deficiency, homocysteine levels can be reduced by administration of high-dose supplements of folic acid and vitamins B(6) and B(12). Prior studies of B vitamins to reduce homocysteine in AD have not had sufficient size or duration to assess their effect on cognitive decline. OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy and safety of B vitamin supplementation in the treatment of AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial of high-dose folate, vitamin B(6), and vitamin B(12) supplementation in 409 (of 601 screened) individuals with mild to moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination scores between 14 and 26, inclusive) and normal folic acid, vitamin B(12), and homocysteine levels. The study was conducted between February 20, 2003, and December 15, 2006, at clinical research sites of the Alzheimer Disease Cooperative Study located throughout the United States. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned to 2 groups of unequal size to increase enrollment (60% treated with high-dose supplements [5 mg/d of folate, 25 mg/d of vitamin B(6), 1 mg/d of vitamin B(12)] and 40% treated with identical placebo); duration of treatment was 18 months.

RESULTS: A total of 340 participants (202 in active treatment group and 138 in placebo group) completed the trial while taking study medication. Although the vitamin supplement regimen was effective in reducing homocysteine levels (mean [SD], -2.42 [3.35] in active treatment group vs -0.86 [2.59] in placebo group; P < .001), it had no beneficial effect on the primary cognitive measure, rate of change in ADAS-cog score during 18 months (0.372 points per month for placebo group vs 0.401 points per month for active treatment group, P = .52; 95% confidence interval of rate difference, -0.06 to 0.12; based on the intention-to-treat generalized estimating equations model), or on any secondary measures.

To evaluate this hypothesis, we first transfected LDLR minigenes into SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and found that the rs688T allele reduces exon 12 inclusion in this neural model. We then evaluated the association of rs688 allele with exon 12 splicing efficiency in vivo by quantifying LDLR splicing in human anterior cingulate tissue obtained at autopsy; the rs688T allele is associated with decreased LDLR exon 12 splicing efficiency in aged males, but not females. Lastly, we evaluated whether rs688 associates with AD by genotyping DNA from 1457 men and 2055 women drawn from three case-control series. The rs688T/T genotype was associated with increased AD odds in males [recessive model, odds ratio (OR) of 1.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.13-1.97, uncorrected P = 0.005], but not in females.

We found that in rat neurons, synaptic activity, acting via NMDA receptor (NMDAR) signaling, boosted antioxidant defenses by making changes to the thioredoxin-peroxiredoxin (Prx) system. Synaptic activity enhanced thioredoxin activity, facilitated the reduction of overoxidized Prxs and promoted resistance to oxidative stress. Resistance was mediated by coordinated transcriptional changes; synaptic NMDAR activity inactivated a previously unknown Forkhead box O target gene, the thioredoxin inhibitor Txnip. Conversely, NMDAR blockade upregulated Txnip in vivo and in vitro, where it bound thioredoxin and promoted vulnerability to oxidative damage. Synaptic activity also upregulated the Prx reactivating genes Sesn2 (sestrin 2) and Srxn1 (sulfiredoxin), via C/EBPbeta and AP-1, respectively. Mimicking these expression changes was sufficient to strengthen antioxidant defenses. Trans-synaptic stimulation of synaptic NMDARs was crucial for boosting antioxidant defenses; chronic bath activation of all (synaptic and extrasynaptic) NMDARs induced no antioxidative effects.

In contrast, isopeptide immunoreactivity in formic acid extracts was significantly greater in AD than NCI and MCI. The level of insoluble formic acid extractable isopeptide correlated with several measures of cognitive function, including word generation and perceptual speed. Multiple linear regression analyses indicated that insoluble isopeptide immunoreactivity could be accounted for by a combination of factors in the formic acid extract, including Abeta, ubiquitin and tau.

Few methodological approaches offer the means to explore this question on as broad a scale as gene expression profiling. Here, we have evaluated mRNA expression profiles as a function of age in two populations; one consisting of 191 individuals with ages-at-death ranging from 65-100 years and with post-mortem brain mRNA measurements of 13,216 genes and a second with 1240 individuals ages 15-94 and lymphocyte mRNA estimates for 18,519 genes. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among negatively correlated transcripts, an enrichment of mitochondrial genes was evident in both populations, providing a replication of previous studies indicating this as a common signature of aging. Sample differences were prominent, the most significant being a decrease in expression of genes involved in translation in lymphocytes and an increase in genes involved in transcription in brain, suggesting that apart from energy metabolism other basic cell processes are affected by age but in a tissue-specific manner. In assessing genomic architecture, intron/exon sequence length ratios were larger among negatively regulated genes in both samples, suggesting that a decrease in the expression of non-compact genes may also be a general effect of aging. Variance in gene expression itself has been theorized to change with age due to accumulation of somatic mutations and/or increasingly heterogeneous environmental exposures, but we found no evidence for such a trend here.

The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between complement activation and cognition during the development of AD. METHODS: iC3b, C9, Bielschowsky, and Gallyas staining was performed on aged normal (n = 17), mild cognitively impaired (n = 12), and AD (n = 17-18) inferior temporal gyrus specimens. Plaques were counted in 10x fields with high numbers of Bielschowsky-stained plaques. One-way ANOVA was used to determine between-group differences for plaque counts and measures of cognitive function, and linear regression was used to evaluate global cognition as a function of Bielschowsky-stained plaques. Terms for iC3b- and C9-stained plaques were then added sequentially as additional predictors in a ""mediation analysis"" model. RESULTS: Complement was detected on plaques in all groups, and on neurofibrillary tangles only in AD specimens. iC3b, C9, and Bielschowsky-stained plaque counts increased 2.5- to 3-fold in AD vs. other groups (all p < or = 0.01). C9 staining was present on some diffuse plaques, as well as on neuritic plaques. Bielschowsky-stained and complement-stained plaque counts were highly correlated, and were negatively correlated with cognitive measures. When the Bielschowsky plaque count was used as a predictor, its correlations with cognitive measures were statistically significant, but when iC3b and C9 plaque counts were added as additional predictors, these correlations were no longer significant. This loss of significance was attributed to multicollinearity, i.e., high correlations between Bielschowsky-stained and complement-stained plaque counts. CONCLUSION: Both early-stage (iC3b) and late-stage (C9) complement activation occurs on neocortical plaques in subjects across the cognitive spectrum; contrary to previous reports, C9 is present on some diffuse plaques. Because of high correlations between complement-stained and Bielschowsky-stained plaque counts, quantitative assessment of the extent to which complement activation may mediate the relationship between plaques and cognitive function could not be performed.

Consistent with regional specificity of AD, temporal-lobe cortical regions showed the greatest disease-related changes and significantly outperformed any of the clinical or cognitive measures examined for both AD and MCI. Global measures of change in brain structure, including whole-brain and ventricular volumes, were also elevated in AD and MCI, but were less salient when compared to changes in normal subjects.

To determine whether this proteolytic cascade is altered during the progression of AD, we examined human frontal and parietal cortex tissues from aged subjects with a clinical diagnosis of AD, mild cognitive impairment, or no cognitive impairment. The analysis demonstrated greater MMP-9 activity in both AD and mild cognitive impairment compared with no cognitive impairment brain samples (p < 0.01), which supports the notion that a metabolic failure in the NGF-maturation/degradation pathway may be associated with an exacerbated degradation of mNGF in the cerebral cortex in early AD. Moreover, there were inverse correlations between Global Cognitive Score and Mini-Mental State Examination score and MMP-9 activity. These findings suggest that a reduction in mNGF as a consequence of MMP-9-mediated degradation may in part underlie the pathogenesis of cognitive deficits in mild cognitive impairment and AD.",2009-12,1309-1318,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 19915485 PMCID: PMC2810197,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19915485,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Disease Progression; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognition Disorders; Nerve Growth Factor; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9",

Methods: Baseline serum was used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula, for 886 elderly without dementia participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a prospective, observational cohort study. Kidney function was also dichotomized into impairment or no impairment based on eGFR < or ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Structured cognitive testing was performed at baseline and at annual evaluations, using a battery of 19 cognitive tests summarized into global cognition and 5 cognitive domains. Results: In mixed-effects models adjusted for age, sex, and education, a lower eGFR at baseline was associated with a more rapid rate of cognitive decline (estimate 0.0008, SE <0.001, p = 0.017). The increased rate of cognitive decline associated with a 15-mL/min/1.73 m2 lower eGFR at baseline (approximately 1 SD) was similar to the effect of being 3 years older at baseline. Impaired kidney function at baseline was associated with a more rapid rate of cognitive decline (estimate −0.028, SE <0.009, p = 0.003). The increased rate of cognitive decline associated with impaired kidney function at baseline was approximately 75% the effect of ApoE4 allele on the rate of cognitive decline. Baseline kidney function was associated with declines in semantic memory, episodic memory, and working memory but not visuospatial abilities or perceptual speed.

METHODS: We used data from 1238 older persons without dementia from two longitudinal cohort studies (Rush Memory and Aging Project and Minority Aging Research Study) with baseline evaluations of purpose in life and up to 5 years of follow-up to test the hypothesis that greater purpose in life is associated with a reduced risk of mortality among community-dwelling older persons. RESULTS: The mean +/- standard deviation score on the purpose in life measure at baseline was 3.7 +/- 0.5 (range = 2-5), with higher scores indicating greater purpose in life. During the 5-year follow-up (mean = 2.7 years), 151 of 1238 persons (12.2%) died.

SETTING: Academic medical center. Subjects Twenty-nine elderly retired clergy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quantitative measures of alpha7 nAChR binding and Abeta peptide concentration in SFC. RESULTS: Higher concentrations of total Abeta peptide in SFC were associated with clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate AD (P = .02), lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores (P = .003), presence of cortical Abeta plaques (P = .02), and likelihood of AD diagnosis by the National Institute on Aging-Reagan criteria (P = .002).

The T(2) relaxation times were measured throughout the hemispheres. Over time, T(2) values near the edges of the hemispheres decreased rapidly after death, while T(2) values of deep tissue decreased more slowly.

The plasma levels of urate, a water-soluble antioxidant, are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVE: We aimed to test the hypotheses that high plasma urate at baseline is associated with: (1) a reduced rate of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD and (2) a lower rate of cognitive decline in MCI. METHODS: Plasma urate was obtained at baseline from 747 participants in a 3-year, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of donepezil, vitamin E or placebo for delaying the progression of MCI to AD.The association between baseline urate and conversion from MCI to AD was examined by Cox proportional hazards regression. The relationship between baseline urate and cognitive change on the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale was evaluated by longitudinal analysis. RESULTS: Baseline plasma urate was not associated with the rate of conversion of MCI to AD. In the placebo arm, high plasma urate was related to a slower rate of cognitive decline over 3 years, although this was not reproduced in the other treatment arms. CONCLUSION: While plasma urate levels did not predict the progression of MCI to AD, high urate may be associated with a reduced rate of cognitive decline in MCI patients not treated with donepezil or vitamin E.

Using apolipoprotein E genotype (APOE), we examined whether neuropathologic intermediate phenotypes, the pathology underlying clinical AD that presumably lies intermediate in the causal chain, would increase power for genetic associations. METHODS: More than 700 older persons underwent annual evaluation and organ donation as part of the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project. A total of 536 autopsied persons with clinical AD or without dementia with APOE genotyping and a quantitative measure of AD pathology were analyzed. Regression analyses were used to examine the relation of APOE to clinical AD, to the level of cognitive function proximate to death, and to measures of AD neuropathology. RESULTS: APOE epsilon4 was associated with increased odds of clinical AD (p = 3 x 10(-7)), and its association with level of cognition was stronger (p = 8 x 10(-12)). However, the use of quantitative measures of AD pathology markedly enhanced the association (p = 9 x 10(-24)).

However, its association with AD pathology (p = 1 x 10(-5)) was sufficiently strong that it would have warranted follow-up if discovered in a genome-wide association study.

METHODS: Microarray analysis of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons acquired via laser capture microdissection was performed using postmortem brain tissue. Validation was achieved using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analysis. Mechanistic studies were performed using human fibroblasts subjected to overexpression with viral vectors or knockdown via small interference RNA. RESULTS: Expression levels of genes regulating early endosomes (rab5) and late endosomes (rab7) are selectively upregulated in homogeneous populations of CA1 neurons from individuals with mild cognitive impairment and AD. The levels of these genes are selectively increased as antemortem measures of cognition decline during AD progression. Hippocampal quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunoblot analyses confirmed increased levels of these transcripts and their respective protein products. Elevation of select rab GTPases regulating endocytosis paralleled the downregulation of genes encoding the neurotrophin receptors TrkB and TrkC.

The major Aβ-degrading enzymes are neprilysin (NEP), insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), and endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE-1). Although evidence suggests that NEP is down-regulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the role of IDE and ECE in the Aβ accumulation in aging and dementia remains less certain. In this study, we examined mRNA and protein expression, as well as biological activity of NEP, IDE, and ECE-1 in human frontal cortex by real-time RT-PCR for mRNA, immunoblotting for protein, and highly sensitive and specific fluorescence assays for activity. The relationships between Aβ-degrading enzymes and pathologic measures and clinical features were also assessed. The results showed that NEP mRNA, protein level, and activity were decreased in AD compared with normal controls with no cognitive impairment (NCI). In contrast, IDE activity was unchanged, but there was higher expression of IDE mRNA, indicating a possible compensatory reaction because of deficits in activity. ECE-1 expression in AD brain showed no significant difference compared with age-matched controls. Correlation analyses suggested that NEP expression was correlated with Aβ accumulation and clinical diagnosis, being lower in AD than in no cognitive impairment. In contrast, neither IDE nor ECE-1 correlated with Aβ or clinical diagnosis.

Since Casp6 is activated in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients' brains, the targeting of p97 by Casp6 may represent an important step that leads to UPS impairment in AD. Here, we show that p97 is a Casp6 substrate in vitro and in vivo. Casp6 cleavage of recombinant p97 generated two N-terminal fragments of 28 and 20 kDa, which were not generated by the other two effector caspases, Caspase-3 and Caspase-7. ATP binding to the D1 ATPase ring of p97 reduced the susceptibility of the N-domain to caspase-mediated proteolysis. Mass spectrometric analysis identified VAPD(179) as a Casp6 cleavage site within p97's N-domain. An anti-neoepitope serum immunohistochemically detected p97 cleaved at VAPD(179) in the cytoplasm of the cell soma and neurites of hippocampal neurons in MCI and AD. Overexpression of p97 (1-179) fragment, representing p97 cleaved at D179, impaired the degradation of model substrates in the ubiquitin-fusion degradation and the N-end rule pathways, and destabilized endogenous p97.

In contrast, cortical levels of the high-affinity, pro-survival NGF receptor TrkA are reduced in AD despite stable levels of p75(NTR).

Whether cortical levels of sortilin are altered during the progression of AD remains unknown. Therefore, we measured sortilin protein levels in postmortem superior frontal and superior temporal cortical tissues derived from Religious Orders Study subjects clinically diagnosed antemortem with no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI or AD.

SELDI TOF-MS analysis of the IMAC-Cu arrays identified 2 proteins of 11.7 and 13.3 kDa that were both selectively increased ~1.5-1.6-fold in aMCI and AD CSF. Increasing levels of each protein were associated with poorer performance on the Mini Mental State Exam and higher Braak stage.

Regression analyses evaluated the relation of SNP genotypes to continuous measures of AD neuropathology and cognitive function proximate to death. A SNP in the zinc finger protein 224 gene (ZNF224, rs3746319) was associated with both global AD neuropathology (p = 0.009) and global cognition (p = 0.002); whereas, a SNP at the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase locus (PCK1, rs8192708) was selectively associated with global cognition (p = 3.57 x 10(-4)). The association of ZNF224 with cognitive impairment was mediated by neurofibrillary tangles, whereas PCK1 largely influenced cognition independent of AD pathology, as well as Lewy bodies and infarcts.

We investigated tau posttranslational modifications during NFT evolution within the CBF neurons of the nucleus basalis (NB) using tissue from subjects with no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, and AD. The pS422 antibody was used as an early tau pathology marker that labels tau phosphorylated at Ser422; the TauC3 antibody was used to detect later stage tau pathology. Stereologic evaluation of NB tissue immunostained for pS422 and TauC3 revealed an increase in neurons expressing these tau epitopes during disease progression. We also investigated the occurrence of pretangle tau events within cholinergic NB neurons by dual staining for the cholinergic cell marker, p75(NTR), which displays a phenotypic down-regulation within CBF perikarya in AD. As pS422+ neurons increased in number, p75(NTR)+ neurons decreased, and these changes correlated with both AD neuropathology and cognitive decline.

We tested the hypothesis that cerebrovascular pathologies are related to parkinsonian signs. METHODS: We studied brain autopsies from 418 deceased participants from the Religious Order Study, who underwent evaluation of parkinsonian signs with a modified version of the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Brains were evaluated for macroscopic and microinfarcts and the severity of arteriolosclerosis. Regression analyses were used to examine the association of cerebrovascular pathologies with parkinsonian signs. RESULTS: More than 35% of cases (N=149) showed macroscopic infarcts. Almost 30% of cases without macroscopic infarcts showed pathologies not detected by conventional brain imaging: microinfarcts (N=33 [7.9%]), arteriolosclerosis (N=62 [14.8%]), or both (N=24 [5.7%]). Macroscopic infarcts, specifically multiple cortical and ≥1 subcortical macroscopic infarcts, were related to higher global parkinsonian scores. The presence of multiple and cortical microinfarcts was associated with global parkinsonian score. Arteriolosclerosis was associated with global parkinsonian score, but this effect was attenuated and no longer significant after accounting for infarcts. Each of the 3 pathologies was separately associated with parkinsonian gait (macroscopic infarcts [estimate, 0.552; SE, 0.210; P=0.009]; microinfarcts [estimate, 0.424; SE, 0.213; P=0.047]; arteriolosclerosis [estimate, 0.191; SE, 0.056; P<0.001]).

CBF neurons depend on nerve growth factor (NGF) and their cognate receptors (trkA and p75(NTR)) for their survival and maintenance. We recently demonstrated a shift in the balance of NGF and its receptors toward cell death mechanisms during the progression of AD. To address whether gender affects NGF signaling system expression within the CBF, we used single cell RNA amplification and custom microarray technologies to compare gene expression profiles of single cholinergic NB neurons in tissue specimens from male and female members of the Religious Orders Study who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or mild/moderate AD. p75(NTR) expression within male cholinergic NB neurons was unchanged across clinical diagnosis, whereas p75(NTR) mRNA levels in female NB neurons exhibited a ∼40% reduction in AD compared to NCI. Male AD subjects displayed a ∼45% reduction in trkA mRNA levels within NB neurons compared to NCI and MCI. In contrast, NB neuronal trkA expression in females was reduced ∼50% in both MCI and AD compared to NCI. Reduced trkA mRNA levels were associated with poorer global cognitive performance and higher Braak scores in the female subjects. In addition, we found a female-selective reduction in GluR2 AMPA glutamate receptor subunit expression in NB neurons in AD.

METHODS: performance on a composite global measure of cognition was analysed using random effects models for baseline performance and change over time. A profile mixture component was used to identify subgroups with different cognitive trajectories over the study period. RESULTS: from a sample of 1,049 participants (mean age 75 years), three subgroups were identified based on the distribution of baseline performance and change over time. The majority (65%) of participants belonged to a slow decline class that did not experience substantial cognitive decline over the observation period [-0.04 baseline total sample standard deviation (SD) units/year]. About 27% experienced moderate decline (-0.19 SD/year), and 8% belonged to a class experiencing rapid decline (-0.57 SD/year). A subsample analysis revealed that when substantial cognitive decline does occur, the magnitude and rate of decline is correlated with neuropathological processes. CONCLUSIONS: in this sample, the most common pattern of cognitive decline is extremely slow, perceptible on a time scale measured by decades, not years.

In a multivariate model, all except SES had statistically significant effects on Reserve, the strongest of which were CA40 (β = .31) and CAbaseline (β = .28). The Education effect was negative in the full model (β = -.25). Results suggest that leisure cognitive activities throughout adulthood are more important than education in determining reserve.

To address this need, the National Institutes of Health Pain Consortium sponsored an ""Expert Panel Discussion on the Pharmacological Management of Chronic Pain in Older Adults"" conference in September 2010 to identify research gaps and strategies to address them. Specific emphasis was placed on ascertaining gaps regarding use of opioid and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications because of continued uncertainties regarding their risks and benefits. DESIGN: Eighteen panel members provided oral presentations; each was followed by a multidisciplinary panel discussion. Meeting transcripts and panelists' slide presentations were reviewed to identify the gaps and the types of studies and research methods panelists suggested could best address them. RESULTS: Fifteen gaps were identified in the areas of treatment (e.g., uncertainty regarding the long-term safety and efficacy of commonly prescribed analgesics), epidemiology (e.g., lack of knowledge regarding the course of common pain syndromes), and implementation (e.g., limited understanding of optimal strategies to translate evidence-based pain treatments into practice). Analyses of data from electronic health care databases, observational cohort studies, and ongoing cohort studies (augmented with pain and other relevant outcomes measures) were felt to be practical methods for building an age-appropriate evidence base to improve the pharmacologic management of pain in later life. CONCLUSION: Addressing the gaps presented in the current report was judged by the panel to have substantial potential to improve the health and well-being of older adults with chronic pain.",2011-09,1336-1357,Pain Med,PubMed,PMID: 21834914 PMCID: PMC3173592,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21834914,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Humans; Biomedical Research; Evidence-Based Medicine; Analgesia; Analgesics; Pain, Intractable",

Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia of later life are common. Definitions of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI), neuropathology, basic science and pathophysiological aspects, role of neuroimaging and vascular and other associated risk factors, and potential opportunities for prevention and treatment are reviewed. This statement serves as an overall guide for practitioners to gain a better understanding of VCI and dementia, prevention, and treatment. Methods Writing group members were nominated by the writing group co-chairs on the basis of their previous work in relevant topic areas and were approved by the American Heart Association Stroke Council Scientific Statement Oversight Committee, the Council on Epidemiology and Prevention, and the Manuscript Oversight Committee. The writing group used systematic literature reviews (primarily covering publications from 1990 to May 1, 2010), previously published guidelines, personal files, and expert opinion to summarize existing evidence, indicate gaps in current knowledge, and, when appropriate, formulate recommendations using standard American Heart Association criteria. All members of the writing group had the opportunity to comment on the recommendations and approved the final version of this document. After peer review by the American Heart Association, as well as review by the Stroke Council leadership, Council on Epidemiology and Prevention Council, and Scientific Statements Oversight Committee, the statement was approved by the American Heart Association Science Advisory and Coordinating Committee. Results The construct of VCI has been introduced to capture the entire spectrum of cognitive disorders associated with all forms of cerebral vascular brain injury—not solely stroke—ranging from mild cognitive impairment through fully developed dementia. Dysfunction of the neurovascular unit and mechanisms regulating cerebral blood flow are likely to be important components of the pathophysiological processes underlying VCI. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is emerging as an important marker of risk for Alzheimer disease, microinfarction, microhemorrhage and macrohemorrhage of the brain, and VCI. The neuropathology of cognitive impairment in later life is often a mixture of Alzheimer disease and microvascular brain damage, which may overlap and synergize to heighten the risk of cognitive impairment. In this regard, magnetic resonance imaging and other neuroimaging techniques play an important role in the definition and detection of VCI and provide evidence that subcortical forms of VCI with white matter hyperintensities and small deep infarcts are common. In many cases, risk markers for VCI are the same as traditional risk factors for stroke. These risks may include but are not limited to atrial fibrillation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, these same vascular risk factors may be risk markers for Alzheimer disease. Carotid intimal-medial thickness and arterial stiffness are emerging as markers of arterial aging and may serve as risk markers for VCI. Currently, no specific treatments for VCI have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, detection and control of the traditional risk factors for stroke and cardiovascular disease may be effective in the prevention of VCI, even in older people. Conclusions Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia are important. Understanding of VCI has evolved substantially in recent years, based on preclinical, neuropathologic, neuroimaging, physiological, and epidemiological studies. Transdisciplinary, translational, and transactional approaches are recommended to further our understanding of this entity and to better characterize its neuropsychological profile. There is a need for prospective, quantitative, clinical-pathological-neuroimaging studies to improve knowledge of the pathological basis of neuroimaging change and the complex interplay between vascular and Alzheimer disease pathologies in the evolution of clinical VCI and Alzheimer disease. Long-term vascular risk marker interventional studies beginning as early as midlife may be required to prevent or postpone the onset of VCI and Alzheimer disease. Studies of intensive reduction of vascular risk factors in high-risk groups are another important avenue of research.",2011-09,2672-2713,Stroke,PubMed,PMID: 21778438 PMCID: PMC3778669,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3778669/,,

Methods: Choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, [3H]PiB binding, and soluble amyloid-β1–42 (Aβ42) concentration were quantified in precuneus tissue samples harvested postmortem from subjects with no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI, and mild AD and correlated with their last antemortem Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and postmortem pathologic evaluation according to the National Institute on Aging–Reagan criteria, recommendations of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease, and Braak stage. Results: Precuneus ChAT activity was lower in AD than in NCI and was comparable between MCI and NCI. Precuneus [3H]PiB binding and soluble Aβ42 levels were elevated in MCI and significantly higher in AD than in NCI. Across all case subjects, reduced ChAT activity was associated with increased [3H]PiB binding, increased soluble Aβ42, lower MMSE score, presence of the APOE*4 allele, and more advanced AD pathology. Conclusions: Despite accumulating amyloid burden, cholinergic enzyme activity is stable in the precuneus during prodromal AD. A decline in precuneus ChAT activity occurs only in clinical AD, when PiB binding and soluble Aβ42 levels are substantially elevated compared with those in MCI.

To understand the link between motor function and preclinical AD, this article examines: our understanding of motor function and its clinical assessment in cohort studies; the relationship of motor function and loss of cognition in older persons; risk factors for cognitive and motor decline; and the relation of post-mortem indices of AD and motor function prior to death. Together, these data suggest that age-related cognitive and motor decline may share a common causation. Furthermore, individuals with a clinical diagnosis of AD may represent the 'tip of the iceberg', since AD pathology may also account for a substantial proportion of cognitive and motor dysfunction currently considered 'normal aging' in older persons without dementia.

Here we hypothesized that the ""disease signature"" of AD-related cortical thinning, previously identified in patients with mild AD dementia, would be useful as a biomarker to detect anatomic abnormalities consistent with AD in cognitively normal (CN) adults who develop AD dementia after longitudinal follow-up. METHODS: We studied 2 independent samples of adults who were CN when scanned. In sample 1, 8 individuals developing AD dementia (CN-AD converters) after an average of 11.1 years were compared to 25 individuals who remained CN (CN-stable). In sample 2, 7 CN-AD converters (average follow-up 7.1 years) were compared to 25 CN-stable individuals. RESULTS: AD-signature cortical thinning in CN-AD converters in both samples was remarkably similar, about 0.2 mm (p < 0.05). Despite this small absolute difference, Cohen d effect sizes for these differences were very large (> 1). Of the 11 CN individuals with baseline low AD-signature thickness (≥ 1 SD below cohort mean), 55% developed AD dementia over nearly the next decade, while none of the 9 high AD-signature thickness individuals (≥ 1 SD above mean) developed dementia. This marker predicted time to diagnosis of dementia (hazard ratio = 3.4, p < 0.0005); 1 SD of thinning increased dementia risk by 3.4.

RESULTS: Age at onset of FTLD was younger in patients with GRN+ FTLD-TDP vs GRN- FTLD-TDP (median, 58.0 vs 61.0 years; P < .001), as was age at death (median, 65.5 vs 69.0 years; P < .001). Concomitant motor neuron disease was much less common in GRN+ FTLD-TDP vs GRN- FTLD-TDP (5.4% vs 26.3%; P < .001). Fifty different GRN mutations were observed, including 2 novel mutations: c.139delG (p.D47TfsX7) and c.378C>A (p.C126X). The 2 most common GRN mutations were c.1477C>T (p.R493X, found in 18 patients, representing 18.6% of GRN cases) and c.26C>A (p.A9D, found in 6 patients, representing 6.2% of cases). Patients with the c.1477C>T mutation shared a haplotype on chromosome 17; clinically, they resembled patients with other GRN mutations. Patients with the c.26C>A mutation appeared to have a younger age at onset of FTLD and at death and more parkinsonian features than those with other GRN mutations.

We evaluated CR1 (rs6656401), CLU (rs11136000), and PICALM (rs7110631) in 1,666 subjects. We evaluated associations between genotypes and rate of change in cognitive function as well as AD-related pathology. Lastly, we used pathway analysis to determine whether relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms and cognitive decline are mediated through AD pathology. RESULTS: Among our study cohort, the mean years of follow-up were 7.8 for ROS and 4.3 for MAP.

In a mediation analysis, controlling for amyloid pathology strongly attenuated the effect of the CR1 locus on cognitive decline.

Neuropathologic examination documented the presence, number, and location of chronic microinfarcts on 6-μm hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections from cortical and subcortical regions. Multiple regression analyses adjusted for age at death, sex, education, macroscopic infarcts, Alzheimer disease pathology, and Lewy bodies. RESULTS: Microinfarcts were present in 129 of 425 (30%) persons (54 cortical, 80 subcortical, 49 multiple); 58 of 129 (45%) of persons with microinfarcts did not exhibit macroscopic infarcts.

This cohort represents the largest family-based GWAS of LOAD to date, with analyses limited here to the European-American subjects. SNPs near APOE gave highly significant results (e.g., rs2075650, p = 3.2×10(-81)), but no other genome-wide significant evidence for association was obtained in the full sample. Analyses that stratified on APOE genotypes identified SNPs on chromosome 10p14 in CUGBP2 with genome-wide significant evidence for association within APOE ε4 homozygotes (e.g., rs201119, p = 1.5×10(-8)). Association in this gene was replicated in an independent sample consisting of three cohorts.

However, our results provide strong evidence that association with PICALM (rs3851179, p = 0.69 with, and p = 0.039 without, APOE adjustment) and EXOC3L2 is affected by correlation with APOE, and thus may represent spurious association. Our results indicate that genetic structure coupled with ascertainment bias resulting from the strong APOE association affect genome-wide results and interpretation of some recently reported associations.

Reduced levels of these antibodies have been suggested to contribute to the development of this disorder. The conflicting results may be due to polyvalent antibodies, antibody ""masking"" due to Aβ binding, methodological differences, and/or small sample sizes. The objectives of this pilot study were to compare serum anti-Aβ antibody concentrations between AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and elderly noncognitively impaired (NCI) subjects while addressing these issues, and to perform power analyses to determine appropriate group sizes for future studies employing this approach. Methods Serum antibodies to Aβ1-42 monomer and soluble oligomers in AD, MCI, and NCI subjects (10/group) were measured by ELISA, subtracting polyvalent antibody binding and dissociating antibody-antigen complexes. Differences in mean antibody levels were assessed for significance with repeated measures ANOVA using restricted maximum likelihood estimation, using Tukey-Kramer tests and confidence intervals for multiple comparisons. Spearman's rank correlation was used to determine associations between anti-monomer and anti-oligomer antibody concentrations. Estimated sample sizes required to detect effects of various sizes were calculated. Results There were no significant differences between groups for mean anti-Aβ antibody levels, although these tended to be higher in AD than NCI specimens. Estimated group sizes of 328 and 150 for anti-Aβ monomer and oligomer antibodies, respectively, would have been required for 80% power for significance at 0.05 for a 25% increase in the AD mean relative to the NCI mean. Serum antibody concentrations to Aβ monomer and oligomers were strongly associated (correlations: 0.798 for undissociated sera, 0.564 for dissociated sera). Antibody-antigen dissociation significantly increased anti-Aβ monomer but not anti-Aβ oligomer antibody levels. Conclusions The findings in this pilot study are consistent with relatively similar concentrations of specific, non-antigen-bound antibodies to Aβ1-42 monomer and soluble oligomers in AD, MCI, and NCI sera. The differences between groups for these antibodies would have required approximate group sizes of 328 and 150, respectively, for a high probability for statistical significance.

However, the neuropathologic basis of structural MRI changes in the hippocampus in the elderly has not been directly assessed. Postmortem MRI of the aging human brain, combined with histopathology, could be an important tool to address this issue. Therefore, this study combined postmortem MRI and histopathology in 100 elderly subjects from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study. First, to validate the information contained in postmortem MRI data, we tested the hypothesis that postmortem hippocampal volume is smaller in subjects with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease compared to subjects with mild or no cognitive impairment, as observed in antemortem imaging studies. Subsequently, the relations of postmortem hippocampal volume to AD pathology, Lewy bodies, amyloid angiopathy, gross infarcts, microscopic infarcts, and hippocampal sclerosis were examined. It was demonstrated that hippocampal volume was smaller in persons with a clinical diagnosis of AD compared to those with no cognitive impairment (P = 2.6 × 10(-7)) or mild cognitive impairment (P = 9.6 × 10(-7)). Additionally, hippocampal volume was related to multiple cognitive abilities assessed proximate to death, with its strongest association with episodic memory. Among all pathologies investigated, the most significant factors related to lower hippocampal volume were shown to be AD pathology (P = 0.0018) and hippocampal sclerosis (P = 4.2 × 10(-7)). Shape analysis allowed for visualization of the hippocampal regions most associated with volume loss for each of these two pathologies. Overall, this investigation confirmed the relation of hippocampal volume measured postmortem to clinical diagnosis of AD and measures of cognition, and concluded that both AD pathology and hippocampal sclerosis affect hippocampal volume in old age, though the impacts of each pathology on the shape of the hippocampus may differ.",03/07/2005,e26286,PLoS One,PubMed,PMID: 22043314 PMCID: PMC3197137,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22043314,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Autopsy; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Hippocampus; Memory, Episodic; Cognition Disorders; Atrophy; Organ Size",

We first identified dimensions of a battery of 17 neuropsychological tests, and regional measures of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. We then evaluated how cognitive factors were related to dimensions of AD and additional measures of cerebrovascular and Lewy Body disease, and also examined independent effects of brain weight. All cognitive domains had multiple neuropathology determinants that differed by domain. Neocortical neurofibrillary tangles were the strongest predictors of most domains, while medial temporal tangles showed a weaker relationship with episodic memory. Neuritic plaques had relatively strong effects on multiple domains. Lewy bodies and macroscopic infarcts were associated with all domains, while microscopic infarcts had more limited associations.

METHODS: More than 400 older Catholic nuns, priests and brothers recruited from groups across the USA completed annual evaluations for up to 15 years, died and underwent brain autopsy. Each clinical evaluation included administration of a 20-item word reading test and a 15-item vocabulary test, which were combined to form a composite measure of word knowledge. In a uniform neuropathological examination, Alzheimer's disease pathology was quantified with a composite index of plaques and tangles, and the presence of gross and microscopic cerebral infarctions and Lewy bodies was recorded. RESULTS: The post-mortem level of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology was linearly related to rate of decline in word knowledge. Decline was nearly fourfold faster at a relatively high level of pathology (75th percentile) compared with a relatively low level (25th percentile). Neocortical (but not nigral or limbic) Lewy bodies and gross (but not microscopic) cerebral infarction were also associated with a more rapid decline in word knowledge. Effects for word reading and vocabulary were similar, except that gross cerebral infarction was associated with accelerated decline in vocabulary, but not in word reading.

However, some of these individuals exhibit Alzheimer disease neuropathology on autopsy, evidenced by neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in AD-specific brain regions. We conducted a genome-wide association study to identify genetic mechanisms that distinguish non-demented elderly with a heavy NFT burden from those with a low NFT burden. The study included 299 non-demented subjects with autopsy (185 subjects with low and 114 with high NFT levels). Both a genotype test, using logistic regression, and an allele test provided consistent evidence that variants in the RELN gene are associated with neuropathology in the context of cognitive health. Immunohistochemical data for reelin expression in AD-related brain regions added support for these findings. Reelin signaling pathways modulate phosphorylation of tau, the major component of NFTs, either directly or through β-amyloid pathways that influence tau phosphorylation.

We implemented a functional fine-mapping approach, leveraging intermediate phenotypes to identify functional variant(s) within the CR1 locus. Using 1709 subjects (697 deceased) from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, we tested 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the linkage disequilibrium block containing the published CR1 AD SNP (rs6656401) for associations with episodic memory decline, and then examined the functional consequences of the top result. We report that a coding variant in the LHR-D (long homologous repeat D) region of the CR1 gene, rs4844609 (Ser1610Thr, minor allele frequency = 0.02), is associated with episodic memory decline and accounts for the known effect of the index SNP rs6656401 (D' = 1, r(2)= 0.084) on this trait. Further, we demonstrate that the coding variant's effect is largely dependent on an interaction with APOE-ε4 and mediated by an increased burden of AD-related neuropathology. Finally, in our data, this coding variant is also associated with AD susceptibility (joint odds ratio = 1.4). Taken together, our analyses identify a CR1 coding variant that influences episodic memory decline; it is a variant known to alter the conformation of CR1 and points to LHR-D as the functional domain within the CR1 protein that mediates the effect on memory decline. We thus implicate C1q and MBL, which bind to LHR-D, as likely targets of the variant's effect and suggest that CR1 may be an important intermediate in the clearance of Aβ42 particles by C1q.",15/05/2012,2377-2388,Hum Mol Genet,PubMed,PMID: 22343410 PMCID: PMC3335317,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22343410,"Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Cognition Disorders; Female; Gene Frequency; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Haplotypes; Humans; Memory, Episodic; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Phenotype; Plaque, Amyloid; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, Complement",

However, the molecular mechanism by which soluble Aβ activates Fyn remains unknown. Combining the use of human and transgenic mouse brain tissue as well as primary cortical neurons, we demonstrate that soluble Aβ binds to PrP(c) at neuronal dendritic spines in vivo and in vitro where it forms a complex with Fyn, resulting in the activation of the kinase. Using the antibody 6D11 to prevent oligomeric Aβ from binding to PrP(c), we abolished Fyn activation and Fyn-dependent tau hyperphosphorylation induced by endogenous oligomeric Aβ in vitro. Finally, we showed that gene dosage of Prnp regulates Aβ-induced Fyn/tau alterations.

The CLDN2 risk allele is associated with atypical localization of claudin-2 in pancreatic acinar cells. The homozygous (or hemizygous in males) CLDN2 genotype confers the greatest risk, and its alleles interact with alcohol consumption to amplify risk.

CNVs may encompass a single gene or multiple genes and can affect their function. They are hypothesized to play an important role in certain diseases. We previously examined the role of CNVs in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study and identified gene regions overlapped by CNVs only in cases (AD and/or MCI) but not in controls. Using a similar approach as ADNI, we investigated the role of CNVs using 794 AD and 196 neurologically evaluated control non-Hispanic Caucasian NIA-LOAD/NCRAD Family Study participants with DNA derived from blood/brain tissue. The controls had no family history of AD and were unrelated to AD participants. CNV calls were generated and analyzed after detailed quality review. 711 AD cases and 171 controls who passed all quality thresholds were included in case/control association analyses, focusing on candidate gene and genome-wide approaches. We identified genes overlapped by CNV calls only in AD cases but not controls. A trend for lower CNV call rate was observed for deletions as well as duplications in cases compared to controls. Gene-based association analyses confirmed previous findings in the ADNI study (ATXN1, HLA-DPB1, RELN, DOPEY2, GSTT1, CHRFAM7A, ERBB4, NRXN1) and identified a new gene (IMMP2L) that may play a role in AD susceptibility.

We sought to determine whether GBA influences risk of dementia with LBDNCs, Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathologic changes (ADNCs), or both. METHODS: We screened the entire GBA coding region for mutations in controls and in subjects with dementia and LBDNCs and no or low levels of ADNCs (pure dementia with Lewy bodies [pDLB]), LBDNCs and high-level ADNCs (LBD-AD), and high-level ADNCs but without LBDNCs (AD). RESULTS: Among white subjects, pathogenic GBA mutations were identified in 6 of 79 pDLB cases (7.6%), 8 of 222 LBD-AD cases (3.6%), 2 of 243 AD cases (0.8%), and 3 of 381 controls (0.8%). Subjects with pDLB and LBD-AD were more likely to carry mutations than controls (pDLB: odds ratio [OR] = 7.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8-31.9; p = 0.006; LBD-AD: OR = 4.6; CI = 1.2-17.6; p = 0.025), but there was no significant difference in frequencies between the AD and control groups (OR = 1.1; CI = 0.2-6.6; p = 0.92). There was a highly significant trend test across groups (χ(2)(1) = 19.3; p = 1.1 × 10(-5)), with the likelihood of carrying a GBA mutation increasing in the following direction: control/AD < LBD-AD < pDLB. CONCLUSIONS: GBA is a susceptibility gene across the LBD spectrum, but not in AD, and appears to convey a higher risk for PD and pDLB than for LBD-AD. PD and pDLB might be more similar to one another in genetic determinants and pathophysiology than either disease is to LBD-AD.",06/11/2012,1944-1950,Neurology,PubMed,PMID: 23035075 PMCID: PMC3484986,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23035075,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; DNA Mutational Analysis; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors; Logistic Models; Lewy Body Disease; alpha-Synuclein; Frontal Lobe; Glucosylceramidase; Mutation Rate",

There is little known regarding the independent role of Lewy body pathology in cognition impairment, decline and fluctuations in community-dwelling older persons. We examined the contribution of Lewy body pathology to dementia, global cognition, cognitive domains, cognitive decline and fluctuations in 872 autopsied subjects (mean age = 87.9 years) from the Rush Religious Order Study (n = 491) and Memory and Aging Project (n = 381) longitudinal community-based clinical-pathological studies. Dementia was based on a clinical evaluation; annual cognitive performance tests were used to create a measure of global cognition and five cognitive domains. Lewy body type was determined by using α-synuclein immunostained sections of substantia nigra, limbic and neocortical regions. Statistical models included multiple regression models for dementia and cognition and mixed effects models for decline. Cognitive fluctuations were estimated by comparing standard deviations of individual residuals from mean trajectories of decline in those with and without Lewy bodies. All models controlled for age, sex, education, Alzheimer's disease pathology and infarcts. One hundred and fifty-seven subjects (18%) exhibited Lewy body pathology (76 neocortical-type, 54 limbic-type and 27 nigra-predominant). One hundred and three (66%) subjects with Lewy body pathology had a pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Neocortical-type, but not nigral-predominant or limbic-type Lewy body pathology was related to an increased odds of dementia (odds ratio = 3.21; 95% confidence interval = 1.78-5.81) and lower cognition (P < 0.001) including episodic memory function (P < 0.001) proximate to death. Neocortical-type Lewy body pathology was also related to a faster decline in global cognition (P < 0.001), decline in all five specific cognitive domains (all P-values < 0.001), and to fluctuations in decline of working and semantic memory (P-values < 0.001). Limbic-type Lewy body pathology was related to lower and faster decline in visuospatial skills (P = 0.042). The relationship of Lewy body pathology to cognition and dementia was not modified by Alzheimer's disease pathology. Neocortical-type Lewy body pathology is associated with increased odds of dementia; lower and more rapid decline in all cognitive domains including episodic memory and fluctuations in decline in semantic and working memory. Limbic-type Lewy body pathology is specifically associated with lower and more rapid decline in visuospatial skills.

METHODS: Persons without dementia from 2 cohort studies of aging, the Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging Project, agreed to annual clinical evaluation and brain donation. The studies had 19 neuropsychological performance tests in common that assessed 5 cognitive domains. For 296 persons without cognitive impairment who died and underwent postmortem assessment, we quantified AD pathology as a global pathology score, and as amyloid load, paired helical filament tau-positive (PHFtau) tangle density, cerebral infarcts, and LB pathology. Linear regression was used to examine the relation of neuropathology to cognitive abilities, controlling for demographics.

Here, we found an approximate twofold increase over controls in soluble αSyn levels in AD brains in the absence of Lewy body cytopathology. Importantly, soluble αSyn levels were a quantitatively stronger correlate of cognitive impairment than soluble Aβ and tau levels. To examine a putative role for αSyn in modulating cognitive function, we used the Barnes circular maze to assess spatial reference memory in transgenic mice overexpressing human wild-type αSyn. The results revealed that an approximate threefold elevation of αSyn in vivo induced memory deficits similar to those observed in AD mouse models. The neurobiological changes associated with this elevation of soluble αSyn included decreases in selected synaptic vesicle proteins and an alteration of the protein composition of synaptic vesicles. Finally, a synergism between Aβ/APP and human tau seems to be responsible for the abnormal elevation of soluble αSyn in transgenic mice.

However, while global metacognitive inaccuracies are well documented (i.e., low deficit awareness, or anosognosia), the evidence is mixed regarding the effects of AD on local or task-based metacognitive judgments. Here we investigated local metacognition with respect to the confidence-accuracy relationship in episodic memory (i.e., metamemory). AD and control participants studied pictures of common objects and their verbal labels, and then took forced-choice picture recollection tests using the verbal labels as retrieval cues. We found that item-based confidence judgments discriminated between accurate and inaccurate recollection responses in both groups, implicating relatively spared metamemory in AD. By contrast, there was evidence for global metacognitive deficiencies, as AD participants underestimated the severity of their everyday problems compared to an informant's assessment. Within the AD group, individual differences in global metacognition were related to recollection accuracy, and global metacognition for everyday memory problems was related to task-based metacognitive accuracy. These findings suggest that AD can spare the confidence-accuracy relationship in recollection tasks, and that global and local metacognition measures tap overlapping neuropsychological processes.",2012-07,2356-2364,Neuropsychologia,PubMed,PMID: 22722068 PMCID: PMC3399049,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22722068,"Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Neuropsychological Tests; Memory, Episodic; Individuality; Psychomotor Performance; Agnosia; Cues; Judgment",

Studies on human subjects with autopsy confirmation entail numerous potential biases that affect both their general applicability and the validity of the correlations. Many sources of data variability can weaken the apparent correlation between cognitive status and AD neuropathologic changes. Indeed, most persons in advanced old age have significant non-AD brain lesions that may alter cognition independently of AD. Worldwide research efforts have evaluated thousands of human subjects to assess the causes of cognitive impairment in the elderly, and these studies have been interpreted in different ways. We review the literature focusing on the correlation of AD neuropathologic changes (i.e. β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) with cognitive impairment. We discuss the various patterns of brain changes that have been observed in elderly individuals to provide a perspective for understanding AD clinicopathologic correlation and conclude that evidence from many independent research centers strongly supports the existence of a specific disease, as defined by the presence of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.

An alternative approach is the use of multilocus genotype patterns (MLGPs) that combine SNPs at different susceptibility genes. METHODS: Using data from 1,365 subjects in the National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study, we conducted a family-based association study in which we tabulated MLGPs for SNPs at CR1, BIN1, CLU, PICALM, and APOE. We used generalized estimating equations to model episodic memory as the dependent endophenotype of LOAD and the MLGPs as predictors while adjusting for sex, age, and education. RESULTS: Several genotype patterns influenced episodic memory performance. A pattern that included PICALM and CLU was the strongest genotypic profile for lower memory performance (β = -0.32, SE = 0.19, p = 0.021). The effect was stronger after addition of APOE (p = 0.016). Two additional patterns involving PICALM, CR1, and APOE and another pattern involving PICALM, BIN1, and APOE were also associated with significantly poorer memory performance (β = -0.44, SE = 0.09, p = 0.009 and β = -0.29, SE = 0.07, p = 0.012) even after exclusion of patients with LOAD. We also identified genotype pattern involving variants in PICALM, CLU, and APOE as a predictor of better memory performance (β = 0.26, SE = 0.10, p = 0.010). CONCLUSIONS: MLGPs provide an alternative analytical approach to predict an individual's genetic risk for episodic memory performance, a surrogate indicator of LOAD.

METHODS: Participants are 174 older persons without dementia at the beginning of a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study. At annual intervals for 6 to 15 years prior to death, they completed a battery of cognitive performance tests from which previously established composite measures of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed were derived. At death, there was a uniform neuropathologic assessment and levels of diffuse plaques, neuritic plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles were summarized in a composite measure. Change in the 4 cognitive outcomes was analyzed simultaneously in a mixed-effects model that allowed rate of decline to accelerate at a variable point before death. RESULTS: On average, cognitive decline before the terminal period was relatively gradual, and rates of change in different cognitive domains were moderately correlated, ranging from 0.25 (episodic memory-working memory) to 0.46 (episodic memory-semantic memory). By contrast, cognition declined rapidly during the terminal period, and rates of change in different cognitive functions were strongly correlated, ranging from 0.83 (working memory-perceptual speed) to 0.89 (episodic memory-semantic memory, semantic memory-working memory). Higher level of plaques and tangles on postmortem examination was associated with faster preterminal decline and earlier onset of terminal decline but not with rate of terminal decline or correlations between rates of change in different cognitive functions.

Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences",1758-535X,10.1093/gerona/glr262,"OBJECTIVES: Identify the neuroimaging correlates of parkinsonian signs in older adults living in the community. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in 307 adults (82.9 years, 55% women, 39% blacks) concurrently with the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating scale-motor part. Magnetic resonance imaging measures included volume of whole-brain white matter hyperintensities and of gray matter for primary sensorimotor, supplementary motor, medial temporal areas, cerebellum, prefronto-parietal cortex, and basal ganglia. RESULTS: About 25% of the participants had bradykinesia, 26% had gait disturbances, and 12% had tremor. Compared with those without, adults with any one of these signs were older, walked more slowly, had worse scores on tests of cognition, mood and processing speed, and higher white matter hyperintensities volume (all p ≤ .002). Gray matter volume of primary sensorimotor area was associated with bradykinesia (standardized odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.46 [0.31, 0.68], p < .0001), and gray matter volume of medial temporal area was associated with gait disturbances (0.56 [0.42, 0.83], p < .0001), independent of white matter hyperintensities volume and age.

Reduced insulin responses were maximal at the level of IRS-1 and were consistently associated with basal elevations in IRS-1 phosphorylated at serine 616 (IRS-1 pS⁶¹⁶) and IRS-1 pS⁶³⁶/⁶³⁹. In the HF, these candidate biomarkers of brain insulin resistance increased commonly and progressively from normal cases to mild cognitively impaired cases to AD cases regardless of diabetes or APOE ε4 status.

To understand the functional consequences and potential interactions of the associated loci, we explored large-scale data sets interrogating the human genome for evidence of positive natural selection. Our findings provide significant evidence for signatures of recent positive selection acting on several haplotypes carrying AD susceptibility alleles; interestingly, the genes found in these selected haplotypes can be assembled, independently, into a molecular complex via a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network approach. These results suggest a possible coevolution of genes encoding physically-interacting proteins that underlie AD susceptibility and are coexpressed in different tissues. In particular, PICALM, BIN1, CD2AP, and EPHA1 are interconnected through multiple interacting proteins and appear to have coordinated evidence of selection in the same human population, suggesting that they may be involved in the execution of a shared molecular function. This observation may be AD-specific, as the 12 loci associated with Parkinson disease do not demonstrate excess evidence of natural selection.

Earlier data showed that florbetapir F 18 binds with high affinity to β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques in human brain homogenates (Kd=3.7 nM) and has favorable imaging pharmacokinetic properties, including rapid brain penetration and washout. This study used human autopsy brain tissue to evaluate the correlation between in vitro florbetapir F 18 binding and Aβ density measured by established neuropathologic methods. METHODS: The localization and density of florbetapir F 18 binding in frozen and formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections of postmortem brain tissue from 40 patients with a varying degree of neurodegenerative pathology was assessed by standard florbetapir F 18 autoradiography and correlated with the localization and density of Aβ identified by silver staining, thioflavin S staining, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: There were strong quantitative correlations between florbetapir F 18 tissue binding and both Aβ plaques identified by light microscopy (Silver staining and thioflavin S fluorescence) and by immunohistochemical measurements of Aβ using 3 antibodies recognizing different epitopes of the Aβ peptide. Florbetapir F 18 did not bind to neurofibrillary tangles. CONCLUSIONS: Florbetapir F 18 selectively binds Aβ in human brain tissue. The binding intensity was quantitatively correlated with the density of Aβ plaques identified by standard neuropathologic techniques and correlated with the density of Aβ measured by immunohistochemistry. As Aβ plaques are a defining neuropathologic feature for Alzheimer disease, these results support the use of florbetapir F 18 as an amyloid positron emission tomography ligand to identify the presence of Alzheimer disease pathology in patients with signs and symptoms of progressive late-life cognitive impairment.",04/07/2005,ago-16,Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord,PubMed,PMID: 22354138 PMCID: PMC3286131,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22354138,"Humans; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Plaque, Amyloid; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Positron-Emission Tomography; Autopsy; Aniline Compounds; Ethylene Glycols; Autoradiography; Radiopharmaceuticals",

We tested the hypothesis that nigral pathology is related to parkinsonism in older persons without Parkinson disease (PD). METHODS: More than 2,500 persons participating in the Religious Orders Study or the Memory and Aging Project agreed to annual assessment of parkinsonism with a modified version of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale and brain donation. Brains from 744 deceased participants without PD were assessed for nigral neuronal loss and α-synuclein immunopositive Lewy bodies. RESULTS: Mean age at death was 88.5 years. Mean global parkinsonism was 18.6 (standard deviation, 11.90). About ⅓ of cases had mild or more severe nigral neuronal loss, and about 17% had Lewy bodies. In separate regression models that adjusted for age, sex, and education, nigral neuronal loss and Lewy bodies were both related to global parkinsonism (neuronal loss: estimate, 0.231; standard error [SE], 0.068; p < 0.001; Lewy bodies: estimate, 0.291; SE, 0.133; p = 0.029).

By contrast, the association between Lewy bodies and global parkinsonism was attenuated by >60% and was no longer significant (Lewy bodies: estimate, 0.112; SE, 0.148; p = 0.447), suggesting that neuronal loss may mediate the association of Lewy bodies with global parkinsonism.

Thirteen additional variants, present in 23 families, did not segregate with disease, but the frequency of these variants is higher in AD cases than controls, indicating that these variants may also modify risk for disease. The frequency of rare variants in these genes in this series is significantly higher than in the 1,000 genome project (p = 5.09 × 10⁻⁵; OR = 2.21; 95%CI = 1.49-3.28) or an unselected population of 12,481 samples (p = 6.82 × 10⁻⁵; OR = 2.19; 95%CI = 1.347-3.26).

Rac1, a member of the Rho family of GTPases, may interact with the proapoptotic pan-neurotrophin receptor p75(NTR) to induce neuronal cytoskeletal abnormalities in AD NB neurons. Herein, we examined the expression of Rac1b, a constitutively active splice variant of Rac1, in NB cholinergic neurons during AD progression. CBF tissues harvested from people who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment, or AD were immunolabeled for both p75(NTR) and Rac1b. Rac1b appeared as cytoplasmic diffuse granules, loosely aggregated filaments, or compact spheres in p75(NTR)-positive NB neurons. Although Rac1b colocalized with tau cytoskeletal markers, the percentage of p75(NTR)-immunoreactive neurons expressing Rac1b was significantly increased only in AD compared with both mild cognitive impairment and NCI. Furthermore, single-cell gene expression profiling with custom-designed microarrays showed down-regulation of caveolin 2, GNB4, and lipase A in AD Rac1b-positive/p75(NTR)-labeled NB neurons compared with Rac1b-negative/p75(NTR)-positive perikarya in NCI.

Given the biologic overlap between AD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), a leading cause of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) in elderly individuals, we investigated whether rs6656401 increases the risk of CAA-related ICH and influences vascular Aβ deposition. METHODS: We performed a case-control genetic association study of 89 individuals with CAA-related ICH and 280 individuals with ICH unrelated to CAA and compared them with 324 ICH-free control subjects. We also investigated the effect of rs6656401 on risk of recurrent CAA-ICH in a prospective longitudinal cohort of ICH survivors. Finally, association with severity of histopathologic CAA was investigated in 544 autopsy specimens from 2 longitudinal studies of aging. RESULTS: rs6656401 was associated with CAA-ICH (odds ratio [OR] = 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-2.17, p = 8.0 × 10(-4)) as well as with risk of recurrent CAA-ICH (hazard ratio = 1.35, 95% CI 1.04-1.76, p = 0.024).

Adjustment for parenchymal amyloid burden did not cancel this effect, suggesting that, despite the correlation between parenchymal and vascular amyloid pathology, CR1 acts independently on both processes, thus increasing risk of both AD and CAA.

The pathologic and molecular substrate of people diagnosed with MCI is not well established.

Herein, we discuss findings derived from clinical pathologic studies of autopsy cases who died with a clinical diagnosis of MCI. The heterogeneity of clinical MCI imparts significant challenges to any review of this subject. The pathologic substrate of MCI is equally complex and must take into account not only conventional plaque and tangle pathology but also a wide range of cellular, biochemical and molecular deficits, many of which relate to cognitive decline as well as compensatory responses to the progressive disease process. The multifaceted nature of the neuronal disconnection syndrome associated with MCI suggests that there is no single event which precipitates this prodromal stage of AD.

As expected, we find that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility locus, APOE, is strongly associated with rate of cognitive decline (P(DISC) = 5.6 × 10(-9); P(JOINT)= 3.7 × 10(-27)). We additionally discover a variant, rs10808746, which shows consistent effects in the replication cohorts and modestly improved evidence of association in the joint analysis (P(DISC) = 6.7 × 10(-5); P(REP) = 9.4 × 10(-3); P(JOINT) = 2.3 × 10(-5)). This variant influences the expression of 2 adjacent genes, PDE7A and MTFR1, which are potential regulators of inflammation and oxidative injury, respectively. Using aggregate measures of genetic risk, we find that known susceptibility loci for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory diseases are not significantly associated with cognitive decline in our cohort. Our results suggest that intermediate phenotypes, when coupled with larger sample sizes, may be a useful tool to dissect susceptibility loci for age-related cognitive decline and uncover shared molecular pathways with a role in neuronal injury.",2012-05,1017.e1-15,Neurobiol Aging,PubMed,PMID: 22054870 PMCID: PMC3307898,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22054870,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors; Apolipoproteins E; Aging; Cognition Disorders; Genetic Variation; Mitochondrial Proteins; Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 7",

These variants confer distinct functionality to the RyR channel, such as altering Ca(2+) release properties or subcellular localization. Changes in RyR isoform expression and alternative splicing have not been examined for potential roles in AD pathogenesis. Here, we compare mRNA levels of the RyR2 and RyR3 isoforms as well as specific alternatively spliced variants across vulnerable brain regions from postmortem samples of individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. We find an increase in RyR2 transcripts in MCI brains compared with no cognitive impairment.

We tested the hypothesis that these pathologic indices account for the majority of late life cognitive decline. METHODS: A total of 856 deceased participants from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies, Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study, completed a mean of 7.5 annual evaluations, including 17 cognitive tests. Neuropathologic examinations provided quantitative measures of global Alzheimer pathology, amyloid load, tangle density, macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts, and neocortical Lewy bodies. Random coefficient models were used to examine the linear relation of pathologic indices with global cognitive decline. In subsequent analyses, random change point models were used to examine the relation of the pathologic indices with the onset of terminal decline and rates of preterminal and terminal decline (ie, nonlinear decline). RESULTS: Cognition declined a mean of about 0.11 U per year (estimate = -0.109, standard error [SE] = 0.004, p < 0.001), with significant individual differences in rates of decline; the variance estimate for the individual slopes was 0.013 (SE = 0.112, p < 0.001). In separate analyses, global Alzheimer pathology, amyloid, tangles, macroscopic infarcts, and neocortical Lewy bodies were associated with faster rates of decline and explained 22%, 6%, 34%, 2%, and 8% of the variation in decline, respectively. When analyzed simultaneously, the pathologic indices accounted for a total of 41% of the variation in decline, and the majority remained unexplained. Furthermore, in random change point models examining the influence of the pathologic indices on the onset of terminal decline and the preterminal and terminal components of the cognitive trajectory, the common pathologic indices accounted for less than a third of the variation in the onset of terminal decline and rates of preterminal and terminal decline. INTERPRETATION: The pathologic indices of the common causes of dementia are important determinants of cognitive decline in old age and account for a large proportion of the variation in late life cognitive decline. Surprisingly, however, much of the variation in cognitive decline remains unexplained, suggesting that other important determinants of cognitive decline remain to be identified.

The challenge in finding reproducible loci of ischemic stroke susceptibility may be in part related to the etiologic heterogeneity in clinically defined stroke subtypes. In this study, we tested whether known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with stroke or putative stroke risk factors are associated with neuropathologically defined micro- or macroscopic infarcts and with arteriolosclerosis. METHODS: Measures of neuropathology and genotyping were available from 755 deceased participants from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. All donated brains were examined by a board-certified neuropathologist using standardized protocol for the presence of microscopic infarct, macroscopic infarct and arteriolosclerosis (lipohyalinosis). In primary analysis, 74 candidate SNPs previously associated (p < 5 × 10(-8)) with ischemic stroke or known risk factors, including atrial fibrillation (AF), hypertension, diabetes, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level and carotid artery stenosis, were evaluated for association with neuropathologic endpoints. We performed a secondary exploratory analysis to include 93 additional SNPs associated with putative ischemic stroke risk factors including SNPs associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride serum levels, myocardial infarction (MI), coronary artery disease and cerebral white matter disease. Regression models relating SNPs to cerebrovascular neuropathology were adjusted for age at death, gender and cohort membership. RESULTS: The strongest associations seen for both macroscopic and microscopic infarcts were risk variants associated with diabetes. The diabetes risk variant rs7578326 located near the IRS1 locus was associated with both macroscopic (OR = 0.73, p = 0.011) and microscopic (OR = 0.71, p = 0.009) infarct pathology. Another diabetes susceptibility locus (rs12779790) located between the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase ID (CAMK1D) and cell division cycle 123 homolog (CDC123) genes is also associated with both macroscopic (OR = 1.40, p = 0.0292) and microscopic infarcts (OR = 1.43, p = 0.0285). The diabetes risk variant rs864745 within JAZF1 was associated with arteriolosclerosis (OR = 0.80, p = 0.014). We observed suggestive associations with the diabetes risk variant rs7961581 (p = 0.038; between TSPAN8 and LGR5) and rs5215 (p = 0.043; KCNJ11), the LDL risk variant rs11206510 (p = 0.045; PCSK9), as well as the AF risk locus ZFHX3. The CDKN2A/B locus (rs2383207, 9p21), identified initially as a susceptibility allele for MI and recently implicated in large vessel stroke, was associated with macroscopic infarct pathology in our autopsy cohort (OR = 1.26, p = 0.031). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest replication of the candidate CDKN2A/B stroke susceptibility locus with directly measured macroscopic stroke neuropathology, and further implicate several diabetes and other risk variants with secondary, pleiotropic associations to stroke-related pathology in our autopsy cohort.

By contrast, NEP activity was decreased in AD. Similar results were observed in AD-mimic transgenic mice. Studies of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma showed an up-regulation of NEP protein in the cytoplasmic compartment induced by HNE and Aβ; however, NEP activity decreased in cytoplasmic fractions. Activity of NEP in membrane fractions increased at 48 hours and then significantly decreased after treatment with HNE and Aβ. The cytoplasmic/membrane ratio of NEP protein increased at 24 hours and then decreased in both HNE and Aβ treated cells. Both HNE and Aβ up-regulate NEP expression, but NEP enzyme activity did not show the same increase, possibly indicating immature cytoplasmic NEP is less active than membrane associated NEP.

We quantified the burden of the neuropathologies of the three most common causes of dementia [i.e., Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebrovascular disease (CVD), and Lewy body disease (LBD)] and examined their relation with cognitive decline in a large cohort of persons without dementia proximate to death. METHODS: A total of 467 deceased participants without dementia from two longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies, Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study, completed a mean of 7 annual evaluations including 17 cognitive tests. Neuropathologic examinations provided quantitative measures of AD (i.e., amyloid load, tangle density), CVD (i.e., macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts), and neocortical Lewy bodies. Random coefficient models were used to examine the relation of the neuropathologies with rates of global cognitive decline as well as decline in four specific cognitive systems. RESULTS: At autopsy, 82% of persons without dementia had amyloid, 100% had tangles, 29% had macroscopic infarcts, 25% had microinfarcts, and 6% had neocortical Lewy bodies. Global cognition declined a mean of 0.034 unit per year (SE = 0.003, p < 0.001). In separate analyses, amyloid, tangles (p-values <0.001) and neocortical Lewy bodies (p = 0.015) were associated with an increased rate of global cognitive decline; macroscopic infarcts and microinfarcts were not. Further, when analyzed simultaneously, amyloid, tangles, and neocortical Lewy bodies remained associated with global cognitive decline (p-values <0.024). Finally, measures of AD were associated with decline in three of four systems, including episodic memory (i.e., tangles), semantic memory (i.e., amyloid and tangles), and working memory (i.e., amyloid). Lewy bodies also were associated with decline in three of four systems (i.e., semantic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed).

Most cell types, except germ cells and pre-implantation embryos, display relatively stable DNA methylation patterns, with 70-80% of all CpGs being methylated. Despite recent advances, we still have a limited understanding of when, where and how many CpGs participate in genomic regulation. Here we report the in-depth analysis of 42 whole-genome bisulphite sequencing data sets across 30 diverse human cell and tissue types. We observe dynamic regulation for only 21.8% of autosomal CpGs within a normal developmental context, most of which are distal to transcription start sites. These dynamic CpGs co-localize with gene regulatory elements, particularly enhancers and transcription-factor-binding sites, which allow identification of key lineage-specific regulators. In addition, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) often contain single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with cell-type-related diseases as determined by genome-wide association studies. The results also highlight the general inefficiency of whole-genome bisulphite sequencing, as 70-80% of the sequencing reads across these data sets provided little or no relevant information about CpG methylation. To demonstrate further the utility of our DMR set, we use it to classify unknown samples and identify representative signature regions that recapitulate major DNA methylation dynamics. In summary, although in theory every CpG can change its methylation state, our results suggest that only a fraction does so as part of coordinated regulatory programs. Therefore, our selected DMRs can serve as a starting point to guide new, more effective reduced representation approaches to capture the most informative fraction of CpGs, as well as further pinpoint putative regulatory elements.",22/08/2013,477-481,Nature,PubMed,PMID: 23925113 PMCID: PMC3821869,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23925113,"Genome, Human; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Binding Sites; Transcription Factors; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Enhancer Elements, Genetic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Organ Specificity; DNA Methylation; CpG Islands; Sulfites",

A total of 966 subjects who had brain autopsy and comprehensive cognitive testing proximate to death were analyzed. Resilience was quantified as a continuous measure using linear regression modeling, where global cognition was entered as a dependent variable and global pathology was an independent variable. Studentized residuals generated from the model represented the discordance between cognition and pathology, and served as measure of resilience. The relation of resilience index to known risk factors for AD and related variables was examined.

The overarching goal of the conference series is to facilitate the translation of research results into interventions that improve mobility for older adults. RESULTS: Evidence from basic, clinical, and epidemiological studies supports the CNS as an important contributor to mobility limitations in older adults without overt neurologic disease. Three main goals for future work that emerged were as follows: (a) develop models of mobility limitations in older adults that differentiate aging from disease-related processes and that fully integrate CNS with musculoskeletal contributors; (b) quantify the contribution of the CNS to mobility loss in older adults in the absence of overt neurologic diseases; (c) promote cross-disciplinary collaboration to generate new ideas and address current methodological issues and barriers, including real-world mobility measures and life-course approaches.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether AD susceptibility loci from genome-wide association studies affect neuritic plaque pathology and to additionally identify novel risk loci for this trait. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Candidate analysis of single-nucleotide polymorphisms and genome-wide association study in a joint clinicopathologic cohort, including 725 deceased subjects from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (2 prospective, community-based studies), followed by targeted validation in an independent neuroimaging cohort, including 114 subjects from multiple clinical and research centers.

Dysfunction in PAK leads to cofilin activation, drebrin displacement from its actin-binding site, actin depolymerization/severing, and, ultimately, defects in spine dynamics and cognitive impairment in mice. To determine the role of PAK in AD, we first quantified PAK by immunoblotting in homogenates from the parietal neocortex of subjects with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (n = 12), mild cognitive impairment (n = 12), or AD (n = 12). A loss of total PAK, detected in the cortex of AD patients (-39% versus controls), was correlated with cognitive impairment (r(2) = 0.148, p = 0.027) and deposition of total and phosphorylated tau (r(2) = 0.235 and r(2) = 0.206, respectively), but not with Aβ42 (r(2) = 0.056). Accordingly, we found a decrease of total PAK in the cortex of 12- and 20-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, an animal model of AD-like Aβ and tau neuropathologies. To determine whether PAK dysfunction aggravates AD phenotype, 3xTg-AD mice were crossed with dominant-negative PAK mice. PAK inactivation led to obliteration of social recognition in old 3xTg-AD mice, which was associated with a decrease in cortical drebrin (-25%), but without enhancement of Aβ/tau pathology or any clear electrophysiological signature.

We conducted the analyses in a large Caucasian case control data set (n=11,840 cases, 10,931 controls) to determine the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all the five homologous genes and AD risk. Evidence for interactions between SNPs in the five VPS10 domain receptor family genes was determined in epistatic statistical models. We also compared expression levels of SORCS2, SORCS3 and SORT1 in AD and control brains using microarray gene expression analyses and assessed the effects of these genes on γ-secretase processing of APP. Several SNPs in SORL1, SORCS1, SORCS2 and SORCS3 were associated with AD. In addition, four specific linkage disequilibrium blocks in SORCS1, SORCS2 and SORCS3 showed additive epistatic effects on the risk of AD (P≤0.0006). SORCS3, but not SORCS2 or SORT1, showed reduced expression in AD compared with control brains, but knockdown of all the three genes using short hairpin RNAs in HEK293 cells caused a significant threefold increase in APP processing (from P<0.001 to P<0.05). These findings indicate that in addition to SORL1 and SORCS1, variants in other members of the VPS10 domain receptor family (that is, SORCS1, SORCS2, SORCS3) are associated with AD risk and alter APP processing.

However, the standard linear mixed model approach is limited in the face of multidimensional longitudinal data and multiple genotypes. In this setting, the principal components of heritability (PCH) approach may increase efficiency by deriving a linear combination of phenotypes to maximize the heritability attributable to a particular genetic locus. The current study investigated the performance of two PCH methods, the Principal Components of Heritability Association Test (PCHAT) and C2BAT, in detecting association of the known AD susceptibility allele APOE-ϵ4 with cognitive function at baseline and decline in cognition over time. METHODS: PCHAT, C2BAT, and standard linear mixed models were used to test for association between APOE-ϵ4 allele and performance on 19 neuropsychological tests using subjects without dementia at baseline from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) (n = 693) and Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (n = 778). Analyses were conducted across the three methods for three nested phenotype definitions (all 19 measures, executive function and episodic memory measures, and episodic memory only), and for baseline data only versus longitudinal change. RESULTS: In all cases, APOE-ϵ4 was significantly associated with baseline level of and change over time in cognitive function, and PCHAT and C2BAT yielded evidence of association comparable to or stronger than conventional methods.

Random change point models were applied to examine the association of the ε4 allele with onset of terminal decline as well as preterminal and terminal slopes. On average, the onset of terminal decline occurred around 3 years before death, and the rate of terminal decline was eightfold faster than the preterminal decline. The presence of the ε4 allele was associated with an earlier onset of terminal decline and faster rates of decline before and after its onset. After adjusting for AD pathology, the ε4 allele was no longer associated with onset of terminal decline or preterminal slope, and the association with terminal slope became marginal.

Identification of disease-associated variants helps identify targets for genetic testing, prevention, and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic loci associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease in African Americans. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) assembled multiple data sets representing a total of 5896 African Americans (1968 case participants, 3928 control participants) 60 years or older that were collected between 1989 and 2011 at multiple sites. The association of Alzheimer disease with genotyped and imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was assessed in case-control and in family-based data sets. Results from individual data sets were combined to perform an inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis, first with genome-wide analyses and subsequently with gene-based tests for previously reported loci. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Presence of Alzheimer disease according to standardized criteria. RESULTS: Genome-wide significance in fully adjusted models (sex, age, APOE genotype, population stratification) was observed for a SNP in ABCA7 (rs115550680, allele = G; frequency, 0.09 cases and 0.06 controls; odds ratio [OR], 1.79 [95% CI, 1.47-2.12]; P = 2.2 × 10(-9)), which is in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs previously associated with Alzheimer disease in Europeans (0.8 < D' < 0.9).

The microtubule binding protein tau may mediate the effects of amyloid-β in this cascade. Amyloid plaques comprised of insoluble, fibrillar amyloid-β aggregates are the most characteristic feature of Alzheimer's disease. However, the correspondence between the distribution of plaques and the pattern of neurodegeneration is tenuous. This discrepancy has stimulated the investigation of other amyloid-β aggregates, including soluble amyloid-β oligomers. Different soluble amyloid-β oligomers have been studied in several mouse models, but not systematically in humans. Here, we measured three amyloid-β oligomers previously described in mouse models-amyloid-β trimers, Aβ*56 and amyloid-β dimers-in brain tissue from 75 cognitively intact individuals, ranging from young children to the elderly, and 58 impaired subjects with mild cognitive impairment or probable Alzheimer's disease. As in mouse models, where amyloid-β trimers appear to be the fundamental amyloid-β assembly unit of Aβ*56 and are present in young mice prior to memory decline, amyloid-β trimers in humans were present in children and adolescents; their levels rose gradually with age and were significantly above baseline in subjects in their 70s. Aβ*56 levels were negligible in children and young adults, rose significantly above baseline in subjects in their 40s and increased steadily thereafter. Amyloid-β dimers were undetectable until subjects were in their 60s; their levels then increased sharply and correlated with plaque load. Remarkably, in cognitively intact individuals we found strong positive correlations between Aβ*56 and two pathological forms of soluble tau (tau-CP13 and tau-Alz50), and negative correlations between Aβ*56 and two postsynaptic proteins (drebrin and fyn kinase), but none between amyloid-β dimers or amyloid-β trimers and tau or synaptic proteins. Comparing impaired with age-matched unimpaired subjects, we found the highest levels of amyloid-β dimers, but the lowest levels of Aβ*56 and amyloid-β trimers, in subjects with probable Alzheimer's disease.

In Stage 1, we evaluated data for 5,877,918 genotyped and imputed SNPs in Japanese cases (n = 1,008) and controls (n = 1,016). Genome-wide significance was observed with 12 SNPs in the APOE region.

However, these sex differences have not been examined at the level of the molecular clock and not in human cerebral cortex. The authors tested the hypothesis that there are detectable daily rhythms of clock gene expression in human cerebral cortex and that there are significant sex differences in the timing of these rhythms. The expression levels of 3 clock genes-PER2, PER3, and ARNTL1-were quantified in samples of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 490 deceased individuals in 2 cohort studies of older individuals, the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, using mRNA microarray data. Clock gene expression at death was parameterized as a function of time of death using cosine curves and was examined for sex differences in the phase of these curves. Significant daily variation was seen in the expression of PER2 (p = 0.004), PER3 (p = 0.003), and ARNTL1 (p = 0.0005). PER2/3 expression peaked at 10:38 (95% confidence interval [CI], 09:20-11:56) and 10:44 (95% CI, 09:29-11:59), respectively, and ARNTL1 expression peaked in antiphase to this at 21:23 (95% CI, 20:16-22:30).

Individuals with aMCI have increased levels of AD-type neuropathology in multiple regions of the neocortex and hippocampus and demonstrate a loss of synaptic connectivity. Recent neuroimaging studies have reported increased levels of 11C-PiB (Pittsburgh, compound B) in regions of the neocortex including the precuneus region of the medial parietal lobe. This cortical region has been implicated in episodic memory, which is disrupted early in the progression of AD. In this study, unbiased stereology coupled with electron microscopy was used to quantify total synaptic numbers in lamina 3 of the precuneus from short postmortem autopsy tissue harvested from subjects who died at different cognitive stages during the progression of AD. Individuals with aMCI did not reveal a statistically significant decline in total synapses compared to the NCI cohort while the AD group did show a modest but significant decline. Synaptic numbers failed to correlate with several different cognitive tasks including the Mini-Mental State Examination scores and episodic memory scores.

This endeavor is particularly challenging for neuropsychiatric diseases where diagnoses predominantly rely on the clinical presentation, which may be heterogeneous, possibly due to the heterogeneity of the underlying genetic susceptibility factors and environmental exposures. Although genome-wide association studies of various neuropsychiatric diseases have recently identified susceptibility loci, there likely remain additional genetic risk factors that underlie the liability to these conditions. Furthermore, identification and characterization of the causal risk variant(s) in each of these novel susceptibility loci constitute a formidable task, particularly in the absence of any prior knowledge about their function or mechanism of action. Biologically relevant, quantitative phenotypes, i.e., endophenotypes, provide a powerful alternative to the more traditional, binary disease phenotypes in the discovery and characterization of susceptibility genes for neuropsychiatric conditions. In this review, we focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a model neuropsychiatric disease and provide a synopsis of the recent literature on the use of endophenotypes in AD genetics. We highlight gene expression, neuropathology and cognitive endophenotypes in AD, with examples demonstrating the utility of these alternative approaches in the discovery of novel susceptibility genes and pathways.

Measures of disability included self-reported instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and activities of daily living (ADL) disability as well as observed physical function. RESULTS: In multiple regression models adjusted for demographic factors, compared with those with infrequent worship attendance, those with frequent or very frequent attendance had lower levels of IADL and ADL disability and higher levels of physical performance at baseline. These associations remained significant in models that adjusted for health and cognitive status. There was no association between frequency of worship attendance and change in disability or physical function over time.

These rhythms are paralleled by 24-hour rhythms of large portions of the transcriptome. The role of dynamic DNA methylation in influencing these rhythms is uncertain. While recent work in Neurospora suggests that dynamic site-specific circadian rhythms of DNA methylation may play a role in modulating the fungal molecular clock, such rhythms and their relationship to RNA expression have not, to our knowledge, been elucidated in mammalian tissues, including human brain tissues. We hypothesized that 24-hour rhythms of DNA methylation exist in the human brain, and play a role in driving 24-hour rhythms of RNA expression. We analyzed DNA methylation levels in post-mortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples from 738 subjects. We assessed for 24-hour rhythmicity of 420,132 DNA methylation sites throughout the genome by considering methylation levels as a function of clock time of death and parameterizing these data using cosine functions. We determined global statistical significance by permutation. We then related rhythms of DNA methylation with rhythms of RNA expression determined by RNA sequencing. We found evidence of significant 24-hour rhythmicity of DNA methylation. Regions near transcription start sites were enriched for high-amplitude rhythmic DNA methylation sites, which were in turn time locked to 24-hour rhythms of RNA expression of nearby genes, with the nadir of methylation preceding peak transcript expression by 1-3 hours. Weak ante-mortem rest-activity rhythms were associated with lower amplitude DNA methylation rhythms as were older age and the presence of Alzheimer's disease. These findings support the hypothesis that 24-hour rhythms of DNA methylation, particularly near transcription start sites, may play a role in driving 24-hour rhythms of gene expression in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and may be affected by age and Alzheimer's disease.",2014-11,e1004792,PLoS Genet,PubMed,PMID: 25375876 PMCID: PMC4222754,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4222754/; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4222754/; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25375876,"Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Circadian Rhythm; DNA Methylation; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Introns; Prefrontal Cortex; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Transcription Initiation Site; Transcription, Genetic",

Many autopsy studies have reported brains with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are indistinguishable from those of Alzheimer's disease (AD), in the absence of amyloid (Aβ) plaques. For these ""NFT+/Aβ-"" brains, for which formal criteria for AD neuropathologic changes are not met, the NFTs are mostly restricted to structures in the medial temporal lobe, basal forebrain, brainstem, and olfactory areas (bulb and cortex). Symptoms in persons with PART usually range from normal to amnestic cognitive changes, with only a minority exhibiting profound impairment. Because cognitive impairment is often mild, existing clinicopathologic designations, such as ""tangle-only dementia"" and ""tangle-predominant senile dementia"", are imprecise and not appropriate for most subjects. PART is almost universally detectable at autopsy among elderly individuals, yet this pathological process cannot be specifically identified pre-mortem at the present time. Improved biomarkers and tau imaging may enable diagnosis of PART in clinical settings in the future. Indeed, recent studies have identified a common biomarker profile consisting of temporal lobe atrophy and tauopathy without evidence of Aβ accumulation.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects of known Alzheimer disease risk loci in modifying AAO and to estimate their cumulative effect on AAO variation using data from genome-wide association studies in the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium comprises 14 case-control, prospective, and family-based data sets with data on 9162 participants of white race/ethnicity with Alzheimer disease occurring after age 60 years who also had complete AAO information, gathered between 1989 and 2011 at multiple sites by participating studies. Data on genotyped or imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms most significantly associated with risk at 10 confirmed LOAD loci were examined in linear modeling of AAO, and individual data set results were combined using a random-effects, inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis approach to determine whether they contribute to variation in AAO. Aggregate effects of all risk loci on AAO were examined in a burden analysis using genotype scores weighted by risk effect sizes. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age at disease onset abstracted from medical records among participants with LOAD diagnosed per standard criteria. RESULTS: Analysis confirmed the association of APOE with earlier AAO (P = 3.3 × 10(-96)), with associations in CR1 (rs6701713, P = 7.2 × 10(-4)), BIN1 (rs7561528, P = 4.8 × 10(-4)), and PICALM (rs561655, P = 2.2 × 10(-3)) reaching statistical significance (P < .005). Risk alleles individually reduced AAO by 3 to 6 months. Burden analyses demonstrated that APOE contributes to 3.7% of the variation in AAO (R(2) = 0.256) over baseline (R(2) = 0.221), whereas the other 9 loci together contribute to 2.2% of the variation (R(2) = 0.242). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We confirmed an association of APOE (OMIM 107741) variants with AAO among affected participants with LOAD and observed novel associations of CR1 (OMIM 120620), BIN1 (OMIM 601248), and PICALM (OMIM 603025) with AAO. In contrast to earlier hypothetical modeling, we show that the combined effects of Alzheimer disease risk variants on AAO are on the scale of, but do not exceed, the APOE effect. While the aggregate effects of risk loci on AAO may be significant, additional genetic contributions to AAO are individually likely to be small.",2014-11,1394-1404,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 25199842 PMCID: PMC4314944,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25199842,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genotype; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors; Prospective Studies; Age of Onset; Genetic Loci",

We performed a genome-wide association study and analysis of known genetic risk loci for AD dementia using neuropathologic data from 4,914 brain autopsies. Neuropathologic data were used to define clinico-pathologic AD dementia or controls, assess core neuropathologic features of AD (neuritic plaques, NPs; neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs), and evaluate commonly co-morbid neuropathologic changes: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease (LBD), hippocampal sclerosis of the elderly (HS), and vascular brain injury (VBI). Genome-wide significance was observed for clinico-pathologic AD dementia, NPs, NFTs, CAA, and LBD with a number of variants in and around the apolipoprotein E gene (APOE). GalNAc transferase 7 (GALNT7), ATP-Binding Cassette, Sub-Family G (WHITE), Member 1 (ABCG1), and an intergenic region on chromosome 9 were associated with NP score; and Potassium Large Conductance Calcium-Activated Channel, Subfamily M, Beta Member 2 (KCNMB2) was strongly associated with HS.

Correlation of effect sizes for risk of AD dementia with effect size for NFTs or NPs showed positive correlation, while those for risk of VBI showed a moderate negative correlation.

METHODS: In a clinical-pathologic cohort study, 1,764 older persons without cognitive impairment at enrollment completed annual clinical evaluations for a mean of 7.8 years. The evaluations included assessment of depressive symptoms (10-item Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) and cognitive function (battery of 17 performance tests). A total of 582 individuals died during follow-up and underwent a uniform neuropathologic examination to quantify β-amyloid plaques and tau tangle density in multiple brain regions and identify neocortical Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, and gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts. RESULTS: Level of depressive symptoms slightly increased during follow-up. Incident mild cognitive impairment (52.2%) was associated with higher level of depressive symptoms before the diagnosis but not with change in symptoms after the diagnosis; incident dementia (17.9%) was associated with higher symptom level before dementia onset and with more rapid decline in symptoms after dementia onset. None of the neuropathologic markers was related to level of depressive symptoms or change in symptoms over time. In a mixed-effects model adjusted for the neuropathologic markers, higher level of depressive symptoms averaged over evaluations was associated with more rapid global cognitive decline, accounting for 4.4% of the variability in decline not attributable to the neuropathologic markers.

SIGNIFICANCE: The additional genes identified in this study, have an array of functions previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease, including aspects of energy metabolism, protein degradation and the immune system and add further weight to these pathways as potential therapeutic targets in Alzheimer's disease.",06/07/2005,e94661,PLoS One,PubMed,PMID: 24922517 PMCID: PMC4055488,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24922517,"Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Case-Control Studies; Carrier Proteins; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alzheimer Disease; Heat-Shock Proteins; Receptors, Antigen, B-Cell",

Although gray matter changes have been documented to be predictive of cognitive decline culminating in AD among healthy older adults, very little attention has been given to alterations in white matter as a possible MRI biomarker predictive of AD. In this investigation, we examined parahippocampal white matter (PWM) volume derived from baseline MRI scans in two independent samples of 65 cognitively normal older adults, followed longitudinally, to determine if it was predictive of AD risk. The average follow-up period for the two samples was 8.5 years. Comparisons between the stable participants (N=50) and those who declined to AD (N=15) over time revealed a significant difference in baseline PWM volume (p<0.001). Furthermore, baseline PWM volume was predictive not only of time to AD (hazard ratio = 3.1, p<0.05), but also of baseline episodic memory performance (p=0.041).

Methods: Pooled MCR prevalence analysis of individual data from 26,802 adults without dementia and disability aged 60 years and older from 22 cohorts from 17 countries.

Results: At baseline, 2,808 of the 26,802 participants met MCR criteria. Pooled MCR prevalence was 9.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] 8.2%–11.2%). MCR prevalence was higher with older age but there were no sex differences. MCR predicted risk of developing incident cognitive impairment in the pooled sample (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 2.0, 95% CI 1.7–2.4); aHRs were 1.5 to 2.7 in the individual cohorts.

As a result, there is a need to identify a cognitive composite that is sensitive to track preclinical AD decline to be used as a primary endpoint in treatment trials. METHODS: Longitudinal data from initially cognitively normal, 70- to 85-year-old participants in three cohort studies of aging and dementia from the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center were examined to empirically define a composite cognitive endpoint that is sensitive to detect and track cognitive decline before the onset of cognitive impairment. The mean-to-standard deviation ratios (MSDRs) of change over time were calculated in a search for the optimal combination of cognitive tests/subtests drawn from the neuropsychological battery in cognitively normal participants who subsequently progressed to clinical stages of AD during 2- and 5-year periods, using data from those who remained unimpaired during the same period to correct for aging and practice effects. Combinations that performed well were then evaluated for representation of relevant cognitive domains, robustness across individual years before diagnosis, and occurrence of selected items within top performing combinations. RESULTS: The optimal composite cognitive test score comprised seven cognitive tests/subtests with an MSDR = 0.964. By comparison, the most sensitive individual test score was Logical Memory Delayed Recall with an MSDR = 0.64. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a composite cognitive test score representing multiple cognitive domains that has improved power compared with the most sensitive single test item to track preclinical AD decline and evaluate preclinical AD treatments.

Recently, TDP-43 was reported to contribute to pathogenesis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis through its interaction with p65 nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) resulting in abnormal hyperactivation of this signaling pathway in motor neurons. Hence, we investigated the interaction of TDP-43 with p65 in the temporal cortex of subjects with a clinical diagnosis of MCI (n = 12) or AD (n = 12) as well as of age-matched controls with no cognitive impairment (NCI, n = 12). RESULTS: Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence approaches revealed a robust interaction of TDP-43 with p65 in the nucleus of temporal lobe neurons in four individuals with MCI (named MCI-p). These MCI-p cases exhibited high expression levels of soluble TDP-43, p65, phosphorylated p65 and low expression levels of β-amyloid 40 when compared to AD or NCI cases. The analysis of cognitive performance tests showed that MCI-p individuals presented intermediate deficits of global cognition and episodic memory between those of AD cases and of NCI cases and MCI cases with no interaction of TDP-43 with p65. CONCLUSIONS: From these results, we propose that enhanced NF-κB activation due to TDP-43 and p65 interaction may contribute to neuronal dysfunction in MCI individuals with episodic memory deficits.

Disruption of this neuronal population likely affects hippocampal pre- and postsynaptic efficacy underlying episodic memory circuits. Therefore, identifying perturbations in the expression of synaptic gene products within CA1 neurons prior to frank AD is crucial for the development of disease modifying therapies. Here we used custom-designed microarrays to examine progressive alterations in synaptic gene expression within CA1 neurons in cases harvested from the Rush Religious Orders Study who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a putative prodromal AD stage), or mild/moderate AD. Quantitative analysis revealed that 21 out of 28 different transcripts encoding regulators of synaptic function were significantly downregulated (1.4-1.8 fold) in CA1 neurons in MCI and AD compared to NCI, whereas synaptic transcript levels were not significantly different between MCI and AD. The downregulated transcripts encoded regulators of presynaptic vesicle trafficking, including synaptophysin and synaptogyrin, regulators of vesicle docking and fusion/release, such as synaptotagmin and syntaxin 1, and regulators of glutamatergic postsynaptic function, including PSD-95 and synaptopodin. Clinical pathologic correlation analysis revealed that downregulation of these synaptic markers was strongly associated with poorer antemortem cognitive status and postmortem AD pathological criteria such as Braak stage, NIA-Reagan, and CERAD diagnosis. In contrast to the widespread loss of synaptic gene expression observed in CA1 neurons in MCI, transcripts encoding β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), APP family members, and regulators of APP metabolism were not differentially regulated in CA1 neurons across the clinical diagnostic groups. Taken together, these data suggest that CA1 synaptic gene dysregulation occurs early in the cascade of pathogenic molecular events prior to the onset of AD, which may form the basis for novel pharmacological treatment approaches for this dementing disorder.

Compared with Parkinson disease (PD), potential genetic risk factors for mild parkinsonian signs have been largely unexplored. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether PD susceptibility loci are associated with parkinsonism or substantia nigra pathology in a large community-based cohort of older persons. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms from PD genome-wide association studies were evaluated in a joint clinicopathologic cohort. Participants included 1698 individuals and a nested autopsy collection of 821 brains from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, 2 prospective community-based studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were a quantitative measure of global parkinsonism or component measures of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and gait impairment that were based on the motor Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. In secondary analyses, we examined associations with additional quantitative motor traits and postmortem indices, including substantia nigra Lewy bodies and neuronal loss. RESULTS: Parkinson disease risk alleles in the MAPT (rs2942168; P = .0006) and CCDC62 (rs12817488; P = .004) loci were associated with global parkinsonism, and these associations remained after exclusion of patients with a PD diagnosis.

Moreover, REST potently protects neurons from oxidative stress and amyloid β-protein toxicity, and conditional deletion of REST in the mouse brain leads to age-related neurodegeneration. A functional orthologue of REST, Caenorhabditis elegans SPR-4, also protects against oxidative stress and amyloid β-protein toxicity. During normal ageing, REST is induced in part by cell non-autonomous Wnt signalling. However, in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, REST is lost from the nucleus and appears in autophagosomes together with pathological misfolded proteins. Finally, REST levels during ageing are closely correlated with cognitive preservation and longevity. Thus, the activation state of REST may distinguish neuroprotection from neurodegeneration in the ageing brain.",27/03/2014,448-454,Nature,PubMed,PMID: 24670762 PMCID: PMC4110979,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24670762,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Humans; Young Adult; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Neuroprotective Agents; Animals; Mice; Repressor Proteins; Transcription Factors; Gene Expression Regulation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Down-Regulation; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Aging; Neurons; Caenorhabditis elegans Proteins; Longevity; Frontotemporal Dementia; Lewy Body Disease; Up-Regulation; Oxidative Stress; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Autophagy; Cell Death; Cell Nucleus; Phagosomes; Wnt Signaling Pathway",

In the field of Alzheimer's disease (AD) research, it has taken almost three decades for diagnostic nomenclature to undergo major re-examination. The shift towards presymptomatic and pre-dementia stages of AD has brought prevention and treatment trials much closer to each other than before. METHODS: Here we discuss: (i) the impact of diagnostic reliability on the possibilities for developing preventive strategies for AD; (ii) the scientific evidence to support moving from observation to action; (iii) ongoing intervention studies; and (iv) the methodological issues and prospects for balancing strategies for high-risk individuals with those for broad population-based prevention. RESULTS: The associations between neuropathology and cognition are still not entirely clear. In addition, the risk factors for AD dementia and the neuropathological hallmarks of AD may not necessarily be the same. Cognitive impairment has a clearer clinical significance and should therefore remain the main focus of prevention. Risk/protective factors for dementia/AD need to be studied from a life-course perspective. New approaches in prevention trials include enrichment strategies based on genetic risk factors or beta-amyloid biomarkers (at least four ongoing pharmacological trials), and multidomain interventions simultaneously targeting various vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors (at least three ongoing trials). Experience from prevention programmes in other chronic diseases can provide additional methodological improvements. CONCLUSIONS: Building infrastructures for international collaborations is necessary for managing the worldwide public health problem of AD and dementia. The International Database on Aging and Dementia (IDAD) and the European Dementia Prevention Initiative (EDPI) are examples of ongoing international efforts aiming to improve the methodology of preventive studies and provide the basis for larger intervention trials.",2014-03,229-250,J Intern Med,PubMed,PMID: 24605807 PMCID: PMC4390027,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24605807,Humans; Alzheimer's disease; Clinical Trials as Topic; Biomarkers; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors; Cognition; Dementia; Longitudinal Studies; dementia; Aging; biomarkers; Early Diagnosis; Prodromal Symptoms; clinical trials; prevention; Preventive Medicine,

METHODS: Data came from 2,566 persons aged 65 years and older (mean 78.1 years) without dementia at baseline from 2 cohort studies of aging with identical annual diagnostic assessments of dementia. Because both studies require organ donation, ascertainment of mortality was complete and dates of death accurate. Mortality hazard ratios (HRs) after incident AD dementia were estimated per 10-year age strata from proportional hazards models. Population attributable risk percentage was derived to estimate excess mortality after a diagnosis of AD dementia. The number of excess deaths attributable to AD dementia in the United States was then estimated. RESULTS: Over an average of 8 years, 559 participants (21.8%) without dementia at baseline developed AD dementia and 1,090 (42.4%) died. Median time from AD dementia diagnosis to death was 3.8 years. The mortality HR for AD dementia was 4.30 (confidence interval = 3.33, 5.58) for ages 75-84 years and 2.77 (confidence interval = 2.37, 3.23) for ages 85 years and older (too few deaths after AD dementia in ages 65-74 were available to estimate HR).

With changing demographics, the number of persons with dementia will increase rapidly. The treatment and prevention of AD and other dementias, therefore, is an urgent unmet need. There have been considerable advances in understanding the biology of many age-related disorders that cause dementia. Gains in understanding AD have led to the development of ante-mortem biomarkers of traditional neuropathology and the conduct of several phase III interventions in the amyloid-β cascade early in the disease process. Many other intervention strategies are in various stages of development. However, efforts to date have met with limited success. A recent National Institute on Aging Research Summit led to a number of requests for applications. One was to establish multi-disciplinary teams of investigators who use systems biology approaches and stem cell technology to identify a new generation of AD targets. We were recently awarded one of three such grants to build a pipeline that integrates epidemiology, systems biology, and stem cell technology to discover and validate novel therapeutic targets and lead compounds for AD treatment and prevention. Here we describe the two cohorts that provide the data and biospecimens being exploited for our pipeline and describe the available unique datasets.

The proximal cause of such resistance in AD dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) appears to be serine inhibition of IRS-1, a phenomenon likely due to microglial release of inflammatory cytokines triggered by oligomeric Aβ. Studies on animal models of AD and on human brain tissue from MCI cases at high risk of AD dementia have shown that brain insulin resistance and many other pathologic features and symptoms of AD may be greatly reduced or even reversed by treatment with FDA-approved glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs such as liraglutide (Victoza).

Previous pharmacological evidence suggested that up-regulation of endogenous heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in astrocytes promotes transformation of normal mitochondria to CA-like inclusions. Here, we determined whether 1) HMOX1 transfection fosters the accumulation of CA-like inclusions in cultured rat astroglia; 2) the HMOX1 transgene promotes CA formation in the brains of aging GFAP.HMOX1 mice; and 3) brain mitochondrial damage and CA biogenesis are augmented in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a harbinger of AD. METHODS: CA were ascertained in (i) neonatal rat astroglia transfected with flag-tagged human HO-1 cDNA, (ii) brain sections derived from 19month-old GFAP.HMOX1 and wild-type (WT) mice, and (iii) post-mortem hippocampal sections from individuals with mild (MCI) and no cognitive impairment (NCI) after staining with PAS or antisera against HO-1, ubiquitin (Ub), manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), and α-synuclein or tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). RESULTS: HMOX1 transfection induced cytoplasmic vacuolation and the accumulation of PAS+ inclusions in cultured astroglia. Numerous CA-like inclusions stained with PAS and immunoreactive for HO-1, Ub and MnSOD were observed in the brains of GFAP.HMOX1 mice, but were rarely encountered in age-matched, WT controls. Numbers of HO-1-positive CA were significantly increased in certain hippocampal strata of MCI subjects relative to NCI preparations. MnSOD and Ub proteins co-localized to CA in both the control and MCI specimens. CONCLUSIONS: HO-1 promotes mitochondrial damage and CA biogenesis in astrocyte cultures and in the intact aging brain. CA formation is enhanced in the MCI hippocampus and thus occurs relatively early in the pathogenesis of AD.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence rates of dementia and LOAD in unaffected members in the National Institute on Aging Genetics Initiative for Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease/National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease (NIA-LOAD/NCRAD) and Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA) family studies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Families with 2 or more affected siblings who had a clinical or pathological diagnosis of LOAD were recruited as a part of the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD Family Study. A cohort of Caribbean Hispanics with familial LOAD was recruited in a different study at the Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain in New York and from clinics in the Dominican Republic as part of the EFIGA study. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Age-specific incidence rates of LOAD were estimated in the unaffected family members in the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD and EFIGA data sets. We restricted analyses to families with follow-up and complete phenotype information, including 396 NIA-LOAD/NCRAD and 242 EFIGA families. Among the 943 at-risk family members in the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD families, 126 (13.4%) developed dementia, of whom 109 (86.5%) met criteria for LOAD. Among 683 at-risk family members in the EFIGA families, 174 (25.5%) developed dementia during the study period, of whom 145 (83.3%) had LOAD. RESULTS: The annual incidence rates of dementia and LOAD in the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD families per person-year were 0.03 and 0.03, respectively, in participants aged 65 to 74 years; 0.07 and 0.06, respectively, in those aged 75 to 84 years; and 0.08 and 0.07, respectively, in those 85 years or older.

Contrasting these results with the population-based estimates, the incidence was increased by 3-fold for NIA-LOAD/NCRAD families (standardized incidence ratio, 3.44) and 2-fold among the EFIGA compared with the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD families (1.71). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The incidence rates for familial dementia and LOAD in the NIA-LOAD/NCRAD and EFIGA families are significantly higher than population-based estimates. The incidence rates in all groups increase with age.

Co-occurrence of neurodegenerative non-Alzheimer's disease-type proteinopathies is increasingly recognized to be a frequent event in the brains of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, particularly in older people. Owing to the evolving concept of neurodegenerative diseases, clinical and neuropathological diagnostic criteria have changed during the last decades. Autopsy-based studies differ in the selection criteria and also in the applied staining methods used. The present review summarizes the prevalence of mixed brain pathologies reported in recent community-based studies. In these cohorts, irrespective of the clinical symptoms, the frequency of Alzheimer's disease-related pathology is between 19 and 67%, of Lewy body pathology is between 6 and 39%, of vascular pathologies is between 28 and 70%, of TDP-43 proteinopathy is between 13 and 46%, of hippocampal sclerosis is between 3 and 13% and, finally, of mixed pathologies is between 10 and 74%. Some studies also mention tauopathies. White-matter pathologies are not discussed specifically in all studies, although these lesions may be present in more than 80% of the aging brains. In summary, community-based neuropathology studies have shown that complex constellations of underlying pathologies may lead to cognitive decline, and that the number of possible combinations increases in the aging brain. These observations have implications for the prediction of the prognosis, for the development of biomarkers or therapy targets, or for the stratification of patient cohorts for genome-wide studies or, eventually, for therapy trials.",06/07/2005,82,Alzheimers Res Ther,PubMed,PMID: 25419243 PMCID: PMC4239398,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25419243,,

Further, many clinical-pathologic studies find a poor correspondence between levels of neuropathology and the presence of dementia and level of cognitive impairment. The poor correspondence suggests that other factors contribute to the maintenance or loss of cognitive function, with factors associated with the maintenance of function referred to as neural or cognitive reserve. This has led investigators to examine the associations of cognitive and social experiential factors with neuropathology as a first step in disentangling the complex associations between these experiential risk factors, neuropathology, and cognitive impairment. Despite the consistent associations of a range of cognitive and social lifestyle factors with cognitive decline and dementia risk, the extant clinical-pathologic data find only a single factor from one cohort, linguistic ability, related to AD pathology. Other factors, including education, harm avoidance, and emotional neglect, are associated with cerebrovascular disease. Overall, the associations are weak. Some factors, such as education, social networks, and purpose in life, modify the relation of neuropathology to cognition. Finally, some factors such as cognitive activity appear to bypass known pathologies altogether suggesting a more direct association with biologic indices that promote person-specific differences in reserve and resilience.

The primary analysis examined the association between age at surgical menopause and decline in a global cognition score. Secondary analyses examined additional outcomes: 1) decline in 5 cognitive subdomains and 2) a global measure of the burden of AD pathology. In exploratory analyses, we examined the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). We adjusted all models for age, education, smoking, and cohort and stratified by surgical vs natural menopause. RESULTS: For the 32% of subjects with surgical menopause, earlier age at menopause was associated with faster decline in global cognition (p = 0.0007), specifically episodic memory (p = 0.0003) and semantic memory (p = 0.002).

We hypothesized that variants in the sortilin-like receptor (SORL1) gene would affect multiple Alzheimer's phenotypes before the clinical onset of symptoms. Four independent samples were analyzed to determine effects of SORL1 genetic risk variants across the lifespan at multiple phenotypic levels: (1) microstructural integrity of white matter using diffusion tensor imaging in two healthy control samples (n=118, age 18-86; n=68, age 8-40); (2) gene expression using the Braincloud postmortem healthy control sample (n=269, age 0-92) and (3) Alzheimer's neuropathology (amyloid plaques and tau tangles) using a postmortem sample of healthy, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's individuals (n=710, age 66-108). SORL1 risk variants predicted lower white matter fractional anisotropy in an age-independent manner in fronto-temporal white matter tracts in both samples at 5% family-wise error-corrected thresholds. SORL1 risk variants also predicted decreased SORL1 mRNA expression, most prominently during childhood and adolescence, and significantly predicted increases in amyloid pathology in postmortem brain. Importantly, the effects of SORL1 variation on both white matter microstructure and gene expression were observed during neurodevelopmental phases of the human lifespan. Further, the neuropathological mechanism of risk appears to primarily involve amyloidogenic pathways.

We tested the 65 most significant SNPs from the discovery sample for association in the replication sample.

A SPON1 SNP 5.5 kb upstream was associated with decline in the replication sample (rs11606345, P = .002).

However, whether cerebral miRNA networks are dysregulated during the earliest stages of AD remains underexplored. We performed miRNA expression analysis using frontal cortex tissue harvested from subjects who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, a putative prodromal AD stage), or mild AD. Analysis revealed that the miRNA clusters miR-212/132 and miR-23a/23b were down-regulated in the frontal cortex of aMCI subjects. Both miR-212/132 and miR23a/b are predicted to destabilize the message for sirtuin 1 (sirt1); hence, down-regulation of either miR-212/132 or miR-23a/b in frontal cortex should promote sirt1 mRNA expression in this region. qPCR studies revealed that frontal cortex levels of sirt1 were increased in aMCI. Given the ability of frontal cortex to respond to the onset of dementia by neuronal reorganization, these data suggest that miRNA-mediated up-regulation of the sirt1 pathway represents a compensatory response to the onset of the disease. By contrast, qPCR analysis of inferior temporal cortex, an area affected early in the progression of AD, showed no changes in miR-212/132, miR-23a/b, or sirt1 transcripts in the same aMCI subjects. In vitro mechanistic studies showed that coordinated down-regulation of miR-212 and miR-23a increased sirt1 protein expression and provided neuroprotection from β-amyloid toxicity in human neuronal cells. Taken together, these data suggest a novel miRNA-mediated neuroprotective pathway activated during the progression of AD that may be amenable to therapeutic manipulation.",07/07/2005,430,Front Neurosci,PubMed,PMID: 26594146 PMCID: PMC4633499,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26594146,Alzheimer's disease; mild cognitive impairment; frontal cortex; gene expression regulation; microRNAs; miR-212; miR-23a; sirtuin 1,

METHODS: Participants (n = 1,113) came from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies of aging, the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study. All underwent annual clinical evaluations including detailed cognitive testing for a mean of 7.1 years before death. Clinical diagnoses of AD were established after reviewing all clinical data, blinded to neuropathologic information. Neuropathologic examinations provided measures of CAA, AD pathology, macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts, and neocortical Lewy bodies. The association of CAA with AD dementia was examined using logistic regression models, and its association with cognitive decline was examined using linear mixed models. RESULTS: CAA was common, present in 78.9% of participants, and moderately related to AD pathology (ρ = 0.401, p < 0.0001). In analyses adjusted for plaques, tangles, and other common age-related neuropathologies, CAA was associated with an increased odds of AD dementia (odds ratio = 1.237, 95% confidence interval 1.082-1.414) and an increased rate of decline in global cognition, perceptual speed, episodic memory, and semantic memory. The associations of CAA with cognitive outcomes were not driven by the presence of capillary involvement.

More importantly, the decreased sense of smell is an early symptom of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease (PD) and Alzheimer disease. However, the genetic determinants for the sense of smell have been poorly investigated. We here performed the first genome-wide meta-analysis on the sense of smell among 6252 US older adults of European descent from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, the Health, Aging, and Body Composition (Health ABC) study, and the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP). Genome-wide association study analysis was performed first by individual cohorts and then meta-analyzed using fixed-effect models with inverse variance weights. Although no SNPs reached genome-wide statistical significance, we identified 13 loci with suggestive evidence for an association with the sense of smell (Pmeta < 1 × 10). Of these, 2 SNPs at chromosome 17q21.31 (rs199443 in NSF, P = 3.02 × 10; and rs2732614 in KIAA1267-LRRC37A, P = 6.65 × 10) exhibited cis effects on the expression of microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT, 17q21.31) in 447 frontal-cortex samples obtained postmortem and profiled by RNA-seq (P < 1 × 10). Gene-based and pathway-enrichment analyses further implicated MAPT in regulating the sense of smell in older adults. Similar results were obtained after excluding participants who reported a physician-diagnosed PD or use of PD medications. In conclusion, we provide preliminary evidence that the MAPT locus may play a role in regulating the sense of smell in older adults and therefore offer a potential genetic link between poor sense of smell and major neurodegenerative diseases.",2015-11,e1892,Medicine (Baltimore),PubMed,PMID: 26632684 PMCID: PMC5058953,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26632684,"Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genotype; United States; Genome-Wide Association Study; Longitudinal Studies; Prospective Studies; White People; Smell",

Some of these changes are thought to be neurodegenerative, whereas others are conceptualized as compensatory, plasticity-like responses, wherein the remaining inputs reactively innervate vulnerable dendritic regions. Here, we provide evidence that the axospinous synapses of human AD cases and mice harboring AD-linked genetic mutations (the 5XFAD line) exhibit both, in the form of synapse loss and compensatory changes in the synapses that remain. Using array tomography, quantitative conventional electron microscopy, immunogold electron microscopy for AMPARs, and whole-cell patch-clamp physiology, we find that hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons in transgenic mice are host to an age-related synapse loss in their distal dendrites, and that the remaining synapses express more AMPA-type glutamate receptors. Moreover, the number of axonal boutons that synapse with multiple spines is significantly reduced in the transgenic mice. Through serial section electron microscopic analyses of human hippocampal tissue, we further show that putative compensatory changes in synapse strength are also detectable in axospinous synapses of proximal and distal dendrites in human AD cases, and that their multiple synapse boutons may be more powerful than those in non-cognitively impaired human cases. Such findings are consistent with the notion that the pathophysiology of AD is a multivariate product of both neurodegenerative and neuroplastic processes, which may produce adaptive and/or maladaptive responses in hippocampal synaptic strength and plasticity.",2015-11,3143-3165,Brain Struct Funct,PubMed,PMID: 25031178 PMCID: PMC4297585,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25031178,"Alzheimer’s disease; Humans; Male; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Mice; Alzheimer Disease; Neurons; Mice, Transgenic; Hippocampus; Synapses; Pyramidal Cells; Neuronal Plasticity; CA1 Region, Hippocampal; Receptors, AMPA; Dendrites; Presynaptic Terminals; Axons; Synapse; AMPA receptor; Array tomography; Dendrite; Electron microscopy; EPSP; Immunogold; Models, Animal; Patch-clamp physiology; Serial section",

OBJECTIVES: To clarify the percentage of APOE4 carriers and noncarriers with the primary clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate Alzheimer dementia near the end of life and minimal Aβ plaques noted at autopsy and the extent to which these cases are associated with appreciable neurofibrillary degeneration or a primary neuropathologic diagnosis other than AD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data on participants included in this study were obtained from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set, which comprises longitudinal clinical assessments performed at the AD centers funded by the National Institute on Aging. Neuropathology data are available for the subset of participants who died. A total of 100 APOE4 noncarriers and 100 APOE4 carriers had the primary clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate Alzheimer dementia at their last visit, known APOE4 genotype, died within the ensuing 24 months, and underwent neuropathologic evaluation on autopsy. The study was conducted from September 1, 2005, to September 1, 2012; analysis was performed from October 9, 2012, to March 20, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Standardized histopathologic assessments of AD neuropathologic changes were the primary measures of interest in this study, specifically Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease neuritic plaque density score, diffuse plaque density score, and Braak stage for neurofibrillary degeneration. The distributions of scores for these measures were the primary outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 37 APOE4 noncarriers with minimal neuritic plaques, 16 individuals (43.2%) had Braak stages III to VI ratings, and 15 of the others (75.0%) met neuropathologic criteria for other dementia-related diseases. Of the 13 APOE4 carriers with minimal neuritic plaques, 6 individuals (46.2%) had Braak stages III to VI ratings and met neuropathologic criteria for other dementia-related diseases. Similarly, of the 7 APOE4 carriers with minimal neuritic plaques and Braak stages 0 to II, 4 participants (57.1%) were thought to have pathologic changes and alterations resulting from non-AD neuropathologic features. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, more than one-third of APOE4 noncarriers with the primary clinical diagnosis of mild to moderate Alzheimer dementia had minimal Aβ plaque accumulation in the cerebral cortex and, thus, may show limited or no benefit from otherwise effective anti-Aβ treatment.

Body size and shape change as people grow older and these changes differ substantially between men and women. To systematically screen for age- and/or sex-specific effects of genetic variants on BMI and WHRadjBMI, we performed meta-analyses of 114 studies (up to 320,485 individuals of European descent) with genome-wide chip and/or Metabochip data by the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium. Each study tested the association of up to ~2.8M SNPs with BMI and WHRadjBMI in four strata (men ≤50y, men >50y, women ≤50y, women >50y) and summary statistics were combined in stratum-specific meta-analyses. We then screened for variants that showed age-specific effects (G x AGE), sex-specific effects (G x SEX) or age-specific effects that differed between men and women (G x AGE x SEX). For BMI, we identified 15 loci (11 previously established for main effects, four novel) that showed significant (FDR<5%) age-specific effects, of which 11 had larger effects in younger (<50y) than in older adults (≥50y). No sex-dependent effects were identified for BMI. For WHRadjBMI, we identified 44 loci (27 previously established for main effects, 17 novel) with sex-specific effects, of which 28 showed larger effects in women than in men, five showed larger effects in men than in women, and 11 showed opposite effects between sexes. No age-dependent effects were identified for WHRadjBMI. This is the first genome-wide interaction meta-analysis to report convincing evidence of age-dependent genetic effects on BMI. In addition, we confirm the sex-specificity of genetic effects on WHRadjBMI.

Recessive inheritance of complex phenotypes can be linked to long (>1-megabase [Mb]) runs of homozygosity (ROHs) detectable by single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between ROHs and AD in an African American population known to have a risk for AD up to 3 times higher than white individuals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case-control study of a large African American data set previously genotyped on different genome-wide SNP arrays conducted from December 2013 to January 2015. Global and locus-based ROH measurements were analyzed using raw or imputed genotype data. We studied the raw genotypes from 2 case-control subsets grouped based on SNP array: Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium data set (871 cases and 1620 control individuals) and Chicago Health and Aging Project-Indianapolis Ibadan Dementia Study data set (279 cases and 1367 control individuals). We then examined the entire data set using imputed genotypes from 1917 cases and 3858 control individuals. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The ROHs larger than 1 Mb, 2 Mb, or 3 Mb were investigated separately for global burden evaluation, consensus regions, and gene-based analyses. RESULTS: The African American cohort had a low degree of inbreeding (F ~ 0.006). In the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium data set, we detected a significantly higher proportion of cases with ROHs greater than 2 Mb (P = .004) or greater than 3 Mb (P = .02), as well as a significant 114-kilobase consensus region on chr4q31.3 (empirical P value 2 = .04; ROHs >2 Mb). In the Chicago Health and Aging Project-Indianapolis Ibadan Dementia Study data set, we identified a significant 202-kilobase consensus region on Chr15q24.1 (empirical P value 2 = .02; ROHs >1 Mb) and a cluster of 13 significant genes on Chr3p21.31 (empirical P value 2 = .03; ROHs >3 Mb). A total of 43 of 49 nominally significant genes common for both data sets also mapped to Chr3p21.31. Analyses of imputed SNP data from the entire data set confirmed the association of AD with global ROH measurements (12.38 ROHs >1 Mb in cases vs 12.11 in controls; 2.986 Mb average size of ROHs >2 Mb in cases vs 2.889 Mb in controls; and 22% of cases with ROHs >3 Mb vs 19% of controls) and a gene-cluster on Chr3p21.31 (empirical P value 2 = .006-.04; ROHs >3 Mb). Also, we detected a significant association between AD and CLDN17 (empirical P value 2 = .01; ROHs >1 Mb), encoding a protein from the Claudin family, members of which were previously suggested as AD biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: To our knowledge, we discovered the first evidence of increased burden of ROHs among patients with AD from an outbred African American population, which could reflect either the cumulative effect of multiple ROHs to AD or the contribution of specific loci harboring recessive mutations and risk haplotypes in a subset of patients. Sequencing is required to uncover AD variants in these individuals.",2015-11,1313-1323,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 26366463 PMCID: PMC4641052,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26366463,"Aged; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Homozygote; Case-Control Studies; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alzheimer Disease; Black or African American; Chicago; Genes, Recessive; Indiana",

While much effort has focused on understanding the function of tau, little is known about the endogenous mechanisms regulating tau metabolism in vivo and how these contribute to disease. Previously, we have shown that the microRNA (miRNA) cluster miR-132/212 is downregulated in tauopathies such as AD. Here, we report that miR-132/212 deficiency in mice leads to increased tau expression, phosphorylation and aggregation. Using reporter assays and cell-based studies, we demonstrate that miR-132 directly targets tau mRNA to regulate its expression. We identified GSK-3β and PP2B as effectors of abnormal tau phosphorylation in vivo. Deletion of miR-132/212 induced tau aggregation in mice expressing endogenous or human mutant tau, an effect associated with autophagy dysfunction. Conversely, treatment of AD mice with miR-132 mimics restored in part memory function and tau metabolism. Finally, miR-132 and miR-212 levels correlated with insoluble tau and cognitive impairment in humans.

Epidemiological studies have found that the pathological process of AD begins years before a clinical diagnosis is made and can be highly variable within a given population. Characterizing cognitive decline in the preclinical phase of AD is critical for the development of early intervention strategies when disease-modifying therapies may be most effective. In the last decade, there has been an increased interest in the application of change-point models to longitudinal cognitive outcomes prior to and after diagnosis. Most of the proposed statistical methodology for describing decline relies upon distributional assumptions that may not hold. In this article, we introduce a quantile regression with a change-point model for longitudinal data of cognitive function in persons bound to develop AD. A change-point in our model reflects the transition from the cognitive decline due to normal aging to the accelerated decline due to disease progression. Quantile regression avoids common distributional assumptions on cognitive outcomes and allows the covariate effects and the change-point to vary for different quantiles of the response. We provided an approach for estimating the model parameters, including the change-point, and presented inferential procedures based on the asymptotic properties of the estimators. A simulation study showed that the estimation and inferential procedures perform reasonably well in finite samples. The practical use of our model was illustrated by an application to longitudinal episodic memory outcomes from two cohort studies of aging and AD.",2015-09,625-635,Biometrics,PubMed,PMID: 25892034 PMCID: PMC4575281,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25892034,"Humans; Alzheimer's disease; Alzheimer Disease; Longitudinal Studies; Cognitive aging; Sensitivity and Specificity; Cognition Disorders; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Incidence; Regression Analysis; Comorbidity; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Age Distribution; Change-point model; Disease progression; Longitudinal data; Quantile regression",

METHODS: Analyses are based on 2,092 older persons from 3 longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort studies who had no memory or cognitive impairment at baseline. Annual evaluations included clinical classification of dementia plus self-rating and performance testing of memory. At death, there was a uniform neuropathologic examination to quantify 7 dementia-related pathologies. RESULTS: In the full group, memory ratings were modestly correlated with memory performance (intercepts r = 0.26, p < 0.001; slopes r = 0.23, p < 001) and so we regressed each person's memory performance on their memory ratings, and the residuals provided longitudinal indicators of memory awareness. In a subset of 239 persons who developed dementia, episodic memory awareness was stable until a mean of 2.6 years before dementia onset (95% credible interval -2.7, -1.6); thereafter, memory awareness declined rapidly (mean annual change -0.32, 95% credible interval -0.37, -0.28). Older age at baseline was associated with later onset of memory unawareness. In a subset of 385 persons who died and underwent neuropathologic examination, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, tau tangles, and gross cerebral infarcts were related to decline in memory awareness. In the absence of these pathologies, no decline in memory awareness was evident. Results were similar in subgroups with and without dementia.

We aim to elucidate the relationship of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes with amyloid angiopathy in the presence of variable amounts of Alzheimer's pathology. Data came from 1062 autopsied subjects from 2 community-based studies of aging. Common neuropathologies including Alzheimer's disease and amyloid angiopathy were assessed using uniform methods. APOE was genotyped by sequencing the 2 polymorphisms in codons 112 and 158 of exon 4. We examined the associations of APOE with amyloid angiopathy using ordinal logistic regression analyses, controlling for demographics and subsequently Alzheimer's and other common pathologies. Moderate to severe amyloid angiopathy was identified in 35.2% (n = 374) of the subjects; 15.3% (n = 162) of the subjects were APOE ε2 carriers; and 26.1% (n = 277) ε4 carriers. Adjusting for demographics, the presence of ε4 allele, but not ε2, was associated with more severe amyloid angiopathy. After further adjustment for Alzheimer's pathology, both ε2 (odds ratio 1.707, 95% confidence interval 1.236-2.358, p = 0.001) and ε4 (odds ratio 2.284, 95% confidence interval 1.730-3.014, p < 0.001) were independently associated with amyloid angiopathy. The results were confirmed by path analysis. Furthermore, APOE ε4 carriers, but not ε2 carriers, were more likely to have capillary amyloid angiopathy. Accounting for capillary involvement did not alter the APOE associations with amyloid angiopathy. We conclude that both APOE ε2 and ε4 alleles are associated with more severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and the direct effect of ε2 is masked by the allele's negative association with comorbid Alzheimer's pathology.

Accordingly, NF-κB activation was also observed in the hippocampus of a transgenic (5XFAD) mouse model of AD. It has been shown that peptides corresponding to the NF-κB essential modifier (NEMO)-binding domain (NBD) of IκB kinase α (IKKα) or IκB kinase β (IKKβ) specifically inhibit the induction of NF-κB activation without inhibiting the basal NF-κB activity. Interestingly, after intranasal administration, wild-type NBD peptide entered into the hippocampus, reduced hippocampal activation of NF-κB, suppressed hippocampal microglial activation, lowered the burden of Aβ in the hippocampus, attenuated apoptosis of hippocampal neurons, protected plasticity-related molecules, and improved memory and learning in 5XFAD mice.

This project extends the previously identified genotype interactions to an autopsy measure of amyloid, while also testing the same interactions leveraging gene expression data quantified in the prefrontal cortex. 797 participants (251 cognitively normal, 196 mild cognitive impairment, and 350 Alzheimer's disease) were drawn from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. A mean score of amyloid load was calculated across eight brain regions, gene expression levels from frozen sections of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were quantified using RNA amplification, and expression signals were generated using Beadstudio. Three SNPs previously identified in genetic interactions were genotyped using the Illumina 1M genotyping chip. Covariates included age, sex, education, and diagnosis. We were able to evaluate 2 of the 3 previously identified interactions, of which the interaction between GSK3β (rs334543) and APBB2 (rs2585590) was found in this autopsy sample (p = 0.04). We observed a comparable interaction between GSK3β and APBB2 when comparing the highest tertile of gene expression to the lowest tertile, t(1) = -2.03, p = 0.043.

We found that reduced expression of PICALM in AD and murine brain endothelium correlated with amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology and cognitive impairment. Moreover, Picalm deficiency diminished Aβ clearance across the murine blood-brain barrier (BBB) and accelerated Aβ pathology in a manner that was reversible by endothelial PICALM re-expression. Using human brain endothelial monolayers, we found that PICALM regulated PICALM/clathrin-dependent internalization of Aβ bound to the low density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1, a key Aβ clearance receptor, and guided Aβ trafficking to Rab5 and Rab11, leading to Aβ endothelial transcytosis and clearance. PICALM levels and Aβ clearance were reduced in AD-derived endothelial monolayers, which was reversible by adenoviral-mediated PICALM transfer. Inducible pluripotent stem cell-derived human endothelial cells carrying the rs3851179 protective allele exhibited higher PICALM levels and enhanced Aβ clearance.

To elucidate where DNA methylation falls along the causal pathway linking risk factors to disease, we examine causal models to assess its role in the pathology of AD. METHODS: DNA methylation profiles were generated in 740 brain samples using the Illumina HumanMet450K beadset. We focused our analysis on CpG sites from 11 AD susceptibility gene regions. The primary outcome was a quantitative measure of neuritic amyloid plaque (NP), a key early element of AD pathology. We tested four causal models: (1) independent associations, (2) CpG mediating the association of a variant, (3) reverse causality, and (4) genetic variant by CpG interaction. RESULTS: Six genes regions (17 CpGs) showed evidence of CpG associations with NP, independent of genetic variation - BIN1 (5), CLU (5), MS4A6A (3), ABCA7 (2), CD2AP (1), and APOE (1). Together they explained 16.8% of the variability in NP. An interaction effect was seen in the CR1 region for two CpGs, cg10021878 (P = 0.01) and cg05922028 (P = 0.001), in relation to NP. In both cases, subjects with the risk allele rs6656401(AT) (/) (AA) display more methylation being associated with more NP burden, whereas subjects with the rs6656401(TT) protective genotype have an inverse association with more methylation being associated with less NP. INTERPRETATION: These observations suggest that, within known AD susceptibility loci, methylation is related to pathologic processes of AD and may play a largely independent role by influencing gene expression in AD susceptibility loci.",2015-06,636-647,Ann Clin Transl Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 26125039 PMCID: PMC4479524,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26125039,,

Previous studies have reported age-related alterations of methylation levels in the human brain across the lifespan, but little is known about whether the observed association with age is confounded by common neuropathologies among older persons. Using genome-wide DNA methylation data from 740 postmortem brains, we interrogated 420,132 CpG sites across the genome in a cohort of individuals with ages from 66 to 108 years old, a range of ages at which many neuropathologic indices become quite common. We compared the association of DNA methylation prior to and following adjustment for common neuropathologies using a series of linear regression models. In the simplest model adjusting for technical factors including batch effect and bisulfite conversion rate, we found 8156 CpGs associated with age. The number of CpGs associated with age dropped by more than 10% following adjustment for sex. Notably, after adjusting for common neuropathologies, the total number of CpGs associated with age was reduced by approximately 40%, compared to the sex-adjusted model. These data illustrate that the association of methylation changes in the brain with age is inflated if one does not account for age-related brain pathologies.

However, the causality of these associations is unclear. We sought to assess the causal nature of these associations using Mendelian randomization (MR). METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used SNPs associated with each risk factor as instrumental variables in MR analyses. We considered type 2 diabetes (T2D, NSNPs = 49), fasting glucose (NSNPs = 36), insulin resistance (NSNPs = 10), body mass index (BMI, NSNPs = 32), total cholesterol (NSNPs = 73), HDL-cholesterol (NSNPs = 71), LDL-cholesterol (NSNPs = 57), triglycerides (NSNPs = 39), systolic blood pressure (SBP, NSNPs = 24), smoking initiation (NSNPs = 1), smoking quantity (NSNPs = 3), university completion (NSNPs = 2), and years of education (NSNPs = 1). We calculated MR estimates of associations between each exposure and AD risk using an inverse-variance weighted approach, with summary statistics of SNP-AD associations from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project, comprising a total of 17,008 individuals with AD and 37,154 cognitively normal elderly controls. We found that genetically predicted higher SBP was associated with lower AD risk (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation [15.4 mm Hg] of SBP [95% CI]: 0.75 [0.62-0.91]; p = 3.4 × 10(-3)). Genetically predicted higher SBP was also associated with a higher probability of taking antihypertensive medication (p = 6.7 × 10(-8)). Genetically predicted smoking quantity was associated with lower AD risk (OR per ten cigarettes per day [95% CI]: 0.67 [0.51-0.89]; p = 6.5 × 10(-3)), although we were unable to stratify by smoking history; genetically predicted smoking initiation was not associated with AD risk (OR = 0.70 [0.37, 1.33]; p = 0.28). We saw no evidence of causal associations between glycemic traits, T2D, BMI, or educational attainment and risk of AD (all p > 0.1). Potential limitations of this study include the small proportion of intermediate trait variance explained by genetic variants and other implicit limitations of MR analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Inherited lifetime exposure to higher SBP is associated with lower AD risk. These findings suggest that higher blood pressure--or some environmental exposure associated with higher blood pressure, such as use of antihypertensive medications--may reduce AD risk.",2015-06,e1001841; discussion e1001841,PLoS Med,PubMed,PMID: 26079503 PMCID: PMC4469461,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26079503,"Female; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors; Mendelian Randomization Analysis",

This study examines whether pleiotropic genetic effects contribute to this association. Therefore, data were analyzed from a total of 9662 major depressive disorder (MDD) cases and 14,949 controls (with no lifetime MDD diagnosis) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium with additional Dutch and Estonian data. The association of EA and MDD was assessed with logistic regression in 15,138 individuals indicating a significantly negative association in our sample with an odds ratio for MDD 0.78 (0.75-0.82) per standard deviation increase in EA. With data of 884,105 autosomal common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), three methods were applied to test for pleiotropy between MDD and EA: (i) genetic profile risk scores (GPRS) derived from training data for EA (independent meta-analysis on ~120,000 subjects) and MDD (using a 10-fold leave-one-out procedure in the current sample), (ii) bivariate genomic-relationship-matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) and (iii) SNP effect concordance analysis (SECA). With these methods, we found (i) that the EA-GPRS did not predict MDD status, and MDD-GPRS did not predict EA, (ii) a weak negative genetic correlation with bivariate GREML analyses, but this correlation was not consistently significant, (iii) no evidence for concordance of MDD and EA SNP effects with SECA analysis.

On average, participants in these analyses developed mild impairment 5 years after enrollment, progressed to moderate impairment after an additional 3.4 years, and stayed impaired for 2.8 years until death. AD and chronic macroscopic infarcts were associated with a higher risk of progression to mild impairment and subsequently to moderate impairment.

At enrollment in 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort studies, 309 older individuals without cognitive impairment completed a standard conscientiousness measure. Annually thereafter, they completed a battery of 17 cognitive tests. On death, they underwent a uniform neuropathologic examination from which measures of neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies, chronic gross cerebral infarction, and hippocampal sclerosis were derived. The relation of conscientiousness and the neuropathologic markers to cognitive decline was assessed in mixed-effects change point models to accommodate nonlinear cognitive decline. During a mean of 10.7 years of follow-up, annual decline on a composite measure of global cognition (baseline M = 0.082, SD = 0.499) was gradual (estimated M = -0.036, 95% CI [-0.046, -0.025]) until a mean of 3.2 years before death (95% CI [-3.6, -2.8]) when it accelerated to a mean annual loss of 0.369 unit (95% CI [-0.426, -0.317]), a tenfold increase. Higher conscientiousness (baseline M = 33.6, SD = 5.1) was associated with slower terminal decline (estimate = 0.064, 95% CI [0.024, 0.103]) but not preterminal decline (estimate = 0.005, 95% CI [-0.003, 0.013]). After adjustment for neuropathologic burden, conscientiousness was still related to terminal decline (estimate = 0.057, 95% CI [0.019, 0.094]) and accounted for 4% of the variance in terminal slopes. In addition, the association of neocortical Lewy bodies with terminal cognitive decline was attenuated in those with higher conscientiousness.

METHODS: Diagnoses of dementia, probable AD, and MCI in 636 autopsied subjects from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project were based on clinical evaluation and cognitive performance tests. HS was defined as severe neuronal loss and gliosis in the hippocampal CA1 and/or subiculum. The severity and distribution of TDP-43 were assessed, and other age-related pathologies were also documented. RESULTS: HS was more common in those aged >90 years (18.0%) compared to younger subjects (9.2%). HS cases commonly coexisted with TDP-43 pathology (86%), which was more severe (p < 0.001) in HS cases. Although HS also commonly coexisted with AD and Lewy body pathology; only TDP-43 pathology increased the odds of HS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.07-3.34). In logistic regression models accounting for age, TDP-43, and other common age-related pathologies, HS cases had higher odds of dementia (OR = 3.71, 95% CI = 1.93-7.16), MCI, and probable AD (OR = 3.75, 95% CI = 2.01-7.02). In linear regression models, including an interaction term for HS and TDP-43 pathology, HS with coexisting TDP-43 was associated with lower function in multiple cognitive domains, whereas HS without TDP-43 did not have statistically significant associations.

Only two genes, APOE and FOXO3, have shown association with longevity in multiple independent studies. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies including 6,036 longevity cases, age ≥90 years, and 3,757 controls that died between ages 55 and 80 years. We additionally attempted to replicate earlier identified single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with longevity. RESULTS: In our meta-analysis, we found suggestive evidence for the association of SNPs near CADM2 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.81; p value = 9.66 × 10(-7)) and GRIK2 (odds ratio = 1.24; p value = 5.09 × 10(-8)) with longevity.

CONCLUSIONS: We did not identify new genome-wide significant associations with longevity and did not replicate earlier findings except for APOE and FOXO3.

METHODS: Recruited from epidemiological studies of aging and cognition at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center, participants were a community-dwelling cohort of older adults (range 63-98 years) without diagnosis of dementia. The cohort contained roughly equal numbers of Black (n=61) and White (n=63) subjects with groups similar in terms of age, gender, and years of education. Auditory abilities were measured with pure-tone audiometry, speech-in-noise perception, and discrimination thresholds for both static and dynamic spectral patterns. Cognitive performance was evaluated with a 12-test battery assessing episodic, semantic, and working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial abilities. RESULTS: Among the auditory measures, only the static and dynamic spectral-pattern discrimination thresholds were associated with cognitive performance in a regression model that included the demographic covariates race, age, gender, and years of education. Subsequent analysis indicated substantial shared variance among the covariates race and both measures of spectral-pattern discrimination in accounting for cognitive performance. Among cognitive measures, working memory and visuospatial abilities showed the strongest interrelationship to spectral-pattern discrimination performance. CONCLUSIONS: For a cohort of older adults without diagnosis of dementia, neither hearing thresholds nor speech-in-noise ability showed significant association with a summary measure of global cognition.

Experimental work supports a potential link between irregular circadian rhythms and several key risk factors for cardiovascular disease including hypertension, obesity, diabetes and dyslipidemia, collectively termed the metabolic syndrome. While several epidemiological studies have demonstrated an association between shift-work and the components of the metabolic syndrome in working-age adults, there is a relative paucity of data concerning the impact of non-occupational circadian irregularity in older women and men. To address this question, we studied 7 days of actigraphic data from 1137 older woman and men participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a community-based cohort study of the chronic conditions of aging. The regularity of activity rhythms was quantified using the nonparametric interdaily stability metric, and was related to the metabolic syndrome and its components obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia. More regular activity rhythms were associated with a lower odds of having the metabolic syndrome (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.60-0.80, p = 5.8 × 10(-7)), being obese (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.63-0.85, p = 2.5 × 10(-5)), diabetic (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.65-0.90, p = 9.3 × 10(-4)), hypertensive (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.66-0.91, p = 2.0 × 10(-3)) or dyslipidemic (OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.72-0.92, p = 1.2 × 10(-3)). These associations were independent of differences in objectively measured total daily physical activity or rest, and were not accounted for by prevalent coronary artery disease, stroke or peripheral artery disease. Moreover, more regular activity rhythms were associated with lower odds of having cardiovascular disease (OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.73-0.95, p = 5.7 × 10(-3)), an effect that was statistically mediated by the metabolic syndrome. We conclude that irregular activity rhythms are associated with several key components of the metabolic syndrome in older community-dwelling adults, and that the metabolic syndrome statistically partially mediates the association between activity rhythms and prevalent cardiovascular disease. Although additional longitudinal and experimental studies are needed to conclusively delineate the causal relationships underlying these associations, these findings are consistent with preclinical data, and add further support for investigations of the irregularity of activity rhythms as a potential therapeutic target to decrease the burden of cardiovascular disease in older adults.",07/07/2005,802-813,Chronobiol Int,PubMed,PMID: 26061588 PMCID: PMC4542004,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26061588,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; diabetes; Risk Factors; Aging; Memory; Hypertension; Diabetes Complications; Circadian Rhythm; Obesity; Odds Ratio; Actigraphy; cardiovascular disease; circadian rhythms; dyslipidemia; Dyslipidemias; hypertension; metabolic syndrome; Metabolic Syndrome; obesity",

OBJECTIVE: To determine if risk of conversion to mild cognitive impairment or dementia among healthy controls varied as a function of their pattern of neuropsychiatric symptoms. METHOD: We studied individuals in the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center dataset collected from 34 Alzheimer Disease Centers between 2005 and 2013. The analysis included 4,517 volunteers who were ≥60 years old, cognitively normal, and had complete Neuropsychiatric Inventory data at their baseline visit, and had at least one follow-up. We used latent class analysis to identify four classes based on patterns of NPI symptoms. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to determine if time to MCI or dementia varied by baseline latent class membership. RESULTS: We identified four latent classes of neuropsychiatric symptoms: irritable, depressed, complex (depression, apathy, irritability, and nighttime behaviors) and asymptomatic. 873 participants converted to MCI or dementia. Hazard ratios for conversion by class were 1.76 (95% CI: 1.34, 2.33) for the irritable class, 3.20 (95% CI: 2.24, 4.58) for the complex class, and 1.90 (95% CI: 1.49, 2.43) for the depressed class, with the asymptomatic class as the reference. CONCLUSIONS: Membership in all three symptomatic classes was associated with greater risk of conversion to MCI or dementia; the complex class had the greatest risk.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between TBI and EOAD (<65 years). METHODS: We identified 1,449 EOAD, 4,337 late-onset AD (LOAD), and corresponding EOAD-matched and LOAD-matched normal controls (NC) in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform (NACC) database and compared the prevalence of any history of TBI as well as measures of cognition, function, behavior, and neuropathology. For validation, we determined TBI prevalence among 115 well-characterized clinic patients with EOAD. RESULTS: Part A: The prevalence of any TBI in the NACC-database EOAD participants (13.3%) was comparable to that observed in the clinic EOAD patients (13.9%) but significantly higher than in the NACC-database LOAD participants (7.7% ; p <  0.0001) and trended to higher compared to EOAD-matched NC (11.1% ; logistic regression p = 0.053). Part B: When we compared EOAD patients with documented non-acute and non-residually impairing TBI to EOAD without a documented history of prior TBI, those with TBI had significantly more disinhibition. Part C: Autopsies did not reveal differences in AD neuropathology based on a history of TBI. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest, but do not establish, that TBI is a specific risk factor for EOAD and may lead to disinhibition, a feature that often results from the frontal effects of head injury.

Here, we pursue a targeted analysis of the TREM locus in relation to cognitive decline and pathological features of AD. METHODS: Clinical, cognitive, and neuropathological phenotypes were collected in 3 prospective cohorts on aging (n = 3,421 subjects). Our primary analysis was an association with neuritic plaque pathology. To functionally characterize the associated variants, we used flow cytometry to measure TREM1 expression on monocytes. RESULTS: We provide evidence that an intronic variant, rs6910730(G) , in TREM1, is associated with an increased burden of neuritic plaques (p = 3.7 × 10(-4) ), diffuse plaques (p = 4.1 × 10(-3) ), and Aβ density (p = 2.6 × 10(-3) ) as well as an increased rate of cognitive decline (p = 5.3 × 10(-3) ). A variant upstream of TREM2, rs7759295(C) , is independently associated with an increased tau tangle density (p = 4.9 × 10(-4) ), an increased burden of neurofibrillary tangles (p = 9.1 × 10(-3) ), and an increased rate of cognitive decline (p = 2.3 × 10(-3) ). Finally, a cytometric analysis shows that the TREM1 rs6910730(G) allele is associated with decreased TREM1 expression on the surface of myeloid cells (p = 1.7 × 10(-3) ).

However, considerable heterogeneity remains in residual decline (i.e., person-specific trajectories of cognitive decline adjusted for these common neuropathologic conditions). The present study aimed to characterize profiles of residual decline in late life cognition. METHOD: Up to 19 waves of longitudinal cognitive data were collected from 876 autopsied participants from 2 ongoing clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging. Uniform neuropathologic examinations quantified measures of Alzheimer's disease, cerebral infarcts, Lewy body disease, and hippocampal sclerosis. Random effects mixture models characterized latent profiles of residual decline in global cognition. RESULTS: We identified 4 latent groups, and each group demonstrated distinct residual decline profiles. On average, 44% of the participants had little or no decline, 35% showed moderate decline, 13% showed severe decline and the rest (8%) had substantial within-subject fluctuation of longitudinal cognitive measures. These latent groups differed in psychological, experiential and neurobiologic factors that have been previously shown to be associated with cognitive decline. Specifically, compared with nondecliners, decliners had more depressive symptoms, were more socially isolated; were less engaged in cognitive or physical activities; and had lower density of noradrenergic neurons in locus ceruleus. CONCLUSIONS: After controlling for common dementia related pathologies, considerable residual variability remains in cognitive aging trajectories and this variability is not random but rather is related to markers of cognitive and neural reserve.

We tested the hypothesis that aPLs are associated with a higher odds of brain infarcts among older, community-dwelling individuals who came to autopsy. METHODS AND RESULTS: Specimens and clinical and pathological data were derived from 607 deceased subjects (mean age at death, 89 years; 66% women) who were participating in 1 of 2 cohort studies of aging (Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study) and had agreed to brain autopsy. Brain infarcts were identified on gross and microscopic examinations, and severity of cerebral vessel disease (atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis) was graded. Four clinically used aPLs were measured longitudinally: 3 in serum (anticardiolipin antibodies, β2-glycoprotein I, and anti-phosphatidyl-serine) and 1 in plasma (lupus anticoagulant). A quarter of subjects (142 of 607, 23%) had at least 1 aPL present at baseline (median time interval from baseline to death, 4.6 years), and three quarters of these subjects had persistently positive measures over time.

Several but not all aspects of the genomic landscape are involved in amyloid β metabolism. The moderate concordance of disease among twins suggests other factors, potentially epigenomic factors, are related to AD. We are at the earliest stages of examining the relation of the epigenome to the clinical and pathologic phenotypes that characterize AD. Our literature review suggests that there is some evidence of age-related changes in human brain methylation. Unfortunately, studies of AD have been relatively small with limited coverage of methylation sites and microRNA, let alone other epigenomic marks.

However, to date, few single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have demonstrated genome-wide significance, hampering efforts aimed at determining which genetic variants are most important for cognitive function and which regions drive the genetic associations between cognitive function and disease states. Here, we combine multiple large genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets, from the CHARGE cognitive consortium (n=53 949) and UK Biobank (n=36 035), to partition the genome into 52 functional annotations and an additional 10 annotations describing tissue-specific histone marks. Using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression we show that, in two measures of cognitive function, SNPs associated with cognitive function cluster in regions of the genome that are under evolutionary negative selective pressure. These conserved regions contained ~2.6% of the SNPs from each GWAS but accounted for ~40% of the SNP-based heritability.

In humans, these high levels of Casp6 activity are initially localized in the entorhinal cortex, the area of the brain first affected by the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, according to Braak staging. The reason for the high vulnerability of entorhinal cortex neurons to neurofibrillary tangle pathology and Casp6 activity is unknown. Casp6 activity is involved in axonal degeneration, therefore, one possibility to explain increased vulnerability of the entorhinal cortex neurons would be that the afferent neurons of the olfactory bulb, some of which project their axons to the entorhinal cortex, are equally degenerating. To examine this possibility, we examined the presence of Casp6 activity, neurofibrillary tangle formation and amyloid deposition by immunohistochemistry with neoepitope antisera against the p20 subunit of active Casp6 and Tau cleaved by Casp6 (Tau∆Casp6), phosphorylated Tau paired helical filament (PHF-1) antibodies and anti-β-amyloid antiserum, respectively, in brains from individuals with no or mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia. Co-localization of Casp6 activity, PHF-1 and β-amyloid was detected mostly in the anterior olfactory nucleus (AON) of the olfactory bulb. The levels of active Casp6 in the AON, which were the highest in the AD brains, correlated with PHF-1 levels, but not with β-amyloid levels. AON Tau∆Casp6 levels correlated with entorhinal cortex Casp6 activity and PHF-1 levels. Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that AON Casp6 activity was associated with lower global cognitive function, mini mental state exam, episodic memory and semantic memory scores. These results suggest that AON Casp6 activity could lead to Casp6-mediated degeneration in the entorhinal cortex, but cannot exclude the possibilities that entorhinal cortex degeneration signals degeneration in the AON or that the pathologies occur in both regions independently. Nevertheless, AON Casp6 activity reflects that of the entorhinal cortex.",08/12/2016,127,Acta Neuropathol Commun,PubMed,PMID: 27931265 PMCID: PMC5146837,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27931265,"Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Amyloid beta-Peptides; DNA-Binding Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Memory; Neuropsychological Tests; Hippocampus; Severity of Illness Index; Mild cognitive impairment; Immunohistochemistry; Regression Analysis; Mental Status Schedule; Neurofibrillary tangles; Entorhinal cortex; Caspase 6; Amyloid beta peptide; CA1; Caspase-6; Cognitive scores; Memory scores; Non-cognitively impaired; Olfactory bulb; Olfactory Bulb; Olfactory Cortex; Polycomb-Group Proteins",

The present study seeks to understand whether these individuals go on to develop MCI or dementia by assessing the association between baseline Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) and conversion independent and after adjustment for cognitive tests. METHODS: The NACC database was used to conduct the analysis of which 7,625 participants were initially identified as having more than one visit and who were cognitively normal at their first visit. Cox proportional hazards were used to fit three models that controlled for executive and non-executive cognitive domains. A similar model was used to assess the effect of FAQ subcategories on conversion. RESULTS: Of these individuals, 1,328 converted to either MCI or dementia by visit 10. Converters had a total visit 1 FAQ score significantly higher than non-converters indicating more functional impairment at baseline. After adjustment for cognitive tests, the association between visit 1 FAQ and subsequent conversion was not attenuated. Doing taxes, remembering dates, and traveling were individually identified as significant predictors of conversion. CONCLUSIONS: The FAQ can be used as an indirect measure of functional ability and is associated with conversion to MCI or dementia.

Here, for the first time, we have comprehensively evaluated the entire autophagic process specifically in CA1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampus from early and late-stage AD subjects and nondemented controls. CA1 neurons aspirated by laser capture microdissection were analyzed using a custom-designed microarray comprising 578 neuropathology- and neuroscience-associated genes. Striking upregulation of autophagy-related genes, exceeding that of other gene ontology groups, reflected increases in autophagosome formation and lysosomal biogenesis beginning at early AD stages. Upregulated autophagosome formation was further indicated by elevated gene and protein expression levels for autophagosome components and increased LC3-positive puncta. Increased lysosomal biogenesis was evidenced by activation of MiTF/TFE family transcriptional regulators, particularly TFE3 (transcription factor binding to IGHM enhancer 3) and by elevated expression of their target genes and encoded proteins. Notably, TFEB (transcription factor EB) activation was associated more strongly with glia than neurons. These findings establish that autophagic sequestration is both competent and upregulated in AD. Autophagosome-lysosome fusion is not evidently altered. Despite this early disease response, however, autophagy flux is progressively impeded due to deficient substrate clearance, as reflected by autolysosomal accumulation of LC3-II and SQSTM1/p62 and expansion of autolysosomal size and total area. We propose that sustained induction of autophagy in the face of progressively declining lysosomal clearance of substrates explains the uncommonly robust autophagic pathology and neuritic dystrophy implicated in AD pathogenesis.",2016-12,2467-2483,Autophagy,PubMed,PMID: 27813694 PMCID: PMC5173282,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27813694,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Gene Expression Regulation; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Lysosomes; Alzheimer disease; Neurites; hippocampus; Cathepsin D; Demography; Autophagy; CA1 Region, Hippocampal; autophagosomes; Autophagosomes; autophagy; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; CA1 pyramidal neurons; dystrophic neurites; lysosomes; MTOR; TFE3; TFEB",

Both methods provide necessary information, but the unique contributions of each are rarely considered. This study compares the 2 approaches on their ability to differentially diagnose with accuracy, while controlling for the influence of other relevant demographic and risk variables. METHOD: Archival data requested from the NACC provided clinical diagnostic groups that were paired to 1 another through a genetic matching procedure. For each diagnostic pairing, 2 separate logistic regression models predicting clinical diagnosis were performed and compared on their predictive ability. The shared variance approach was represented through the latent phenotype δ, which served as the lone predictor in 1 set of models. The unique variance approach was represented through raw score values for the 12 neuropsychological test variables comprising δ, which served as the set of predictors in the second group of models. RESULTS: Examining the unique patterns of neuropsychological test performance across a battery of tests was the superior method of differentiating between competing diagnoses, and it accounted for 16-30% of the variance in diagnostic decision making.

However, there is an inadequate understanding of association and possible effects of AC drugs on cognition. This cross-sectional study examines the associations of AC medications on cognition among older adults with questionable cognitive impairment (QCI). Methods For this cross-sectional study, we used multicenter database of community dwelling older adults (N=7,351) aged 60+ years with QCI from September 2005 until March 2014 as baseline data. Anticholinergic Drug Scale was used to categorize AC drug load in no, low or moderate/high groups.

The mean z-scores of neuropsychological tests were grouped into a global cognition score. Results Participants who took AC medications were older, largely female and had higher prevalence of incontinence than those without AC exposure. Global cognition was significantly greater in moderate/high AC group than no AC group (-0.23±0.53 vs. -0.32±0.53). Multivariable linear regression showed that global cognition score among low and moderate/high AC groups, as compared to no AC group, was higher by 0.064 (P=.006 and P=.12, respectively). Conclusions This cross-sectional study indicates that older adults with QCI who were exposed to AC medications might have higher global cognitive scores than those without AC exposure.

METHODS: Participants are 420 older persons from 2 clinical-pathologic studies without cognitive impairment at study onset. They completed a battery of 17 cognitive tests annually for a minimum of 5 years, died, and underwent a neuropathologic examination to quantify neuronal neurofibrillary tangles and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology and to identify Lewy bodies and hippocampal sclerosis. The authors used sigmoid mixed models based on the 4-parameter logistic distribution to decompose nonlinear global cognitive trajectories into components and assess the relation of each neuropathologic marker to each trajectory component. RESULTS: Cognitive function was assessed for a mean of 10.5 years before death. In the absence of pathology, global cognition was relatively stable before declining moderately in the last 3 to 4 years of life. Tangles were related to all trajectory components except initial level. TDP-43 pathology was the only marker related to initial level of function. It was also associated with an earlier midpoint of decline but not to slope of decline. Hippocampal sclerosis was related to an earlier midpoint of decline and more rapid slope of decline. Lewy bodies were associated with faster slope of decline and lower level of function proximate to death. CONCLUSION: Neurodegenerative processes are differentially related to cognitive trajectories, with TDP-43 pathology most potently impacting incipient cognitive decline, AD pathology and hippocampal sclerosis affecting the progression of cognitive decline, and Lewy bodies impacting terminal decline.

We tested the hypothesis that the level of motor function is associated with incident disability in older African Americans after adjusting for cognition. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study of 605 older community-dwelling African American adults without dementia was carried out. Baseline global motor score summarized 11 motor performances, cognition was based on 19 cognitive tests, and self-reported disability was obtained annually. We examined the association of motor function with incident disability (instrumental activities of daily living [IADL], activities of daily living [ADL], and mobility disability) with a series of Cox proportional hazards models which controlled for age, sex, and education. RESULTS: Average follow-up was about 5 years. In proportional hazards models, a 1-SD increase in baseline level of global motor score was associated with about a 50% decrease in the risk of subsequent IADL, ADL, and mobility disability (all p values < .001). These associations were unchanged in analyses controlling for cognition and other covariates. Further, the association of global motor score and incident ADL disability varied with the level of cognition (estimate -5.541, SE 1.634, p < .001), such that higher motor function was more protective at higher levels of cognition. Mobility and dexterity components of global motor score were more strongly associated with incident disability than strength (all p values < .001).

WMH volume also was associated with an increased rate of decline in global cognition (P < 0.001), perceptual speed, working memory, episodic memory, and semantic memory. Associations persisted after adjustment for total gray matter volume, vascular risk factors, and vascular diseases.

We tested the hypotheses that TDP-43 with Alzheimer's disease pathology is a common mixed pathology; is related to increased likelihood of expressing clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia; and that TDP-43 pathologic stage is an important determinant of clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia. Data came from 946 older adults with ( n = 398) and without dementia ( n = 548) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study. TDP-43 proteinopathy (cytoplasmic inclusions) was present in 496 (52%) subjects, and the pattern of deposition was classified as stage 0 (none; 48%), stage 1 (amygdala; 18%), stage 2 (extension to hippocampus/entorhinal; 21%), or stage 3 (extension to neocortex; 14%). TDP-43 pathology combined with a pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was a common mixed pathology (37% of all participants), and the proportion of subjects with clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia formerly labelled 'pure pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease' was halved when TDP-43 was considered. In logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and education, TDP-43 pathology was associated with clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia (odds ratio = 1.51, 95% confidence interval = 1.11, 2.05) independent of pathological Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio = 4.30, 95% confidence interval = 3.08, 6.01) or other pathologies (infarcts, arteriolosclerosis, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis).

We and others have demonstrated that Aβ plaques and NFTs are present in varying degrees before the onset and throughout the progression of dementia. In this regard, aged people with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a presumed prodromal AD transitional state, and AD all present at autopsy with varying levels of pathological hallmarks. Cognitive decline, a requisite for the clinical diagnosis of dementia associated with AD, generally correlates better with NFTs than Aβ plaques. However, correlations are even higher between cognitive decline and synaptic loss. In this review, we illustrate relevant clinical pathological research in preclinical AD and throughout the progression of dementia in several areas including Aβ and tau pathobiology, single population expression profiling of vulnerable hippocampal and basal forebrain neurons, neuroplasticity, neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker studies and their correlation with antemortem cognitive endpoints.

Here, we observed that exposure of cultured primary neurons to Aβ trimers isolated from brain tissue of subjects with Alzheimer's disease led to a specific conformational change of tau detected by the antibody Alz50. A similar association was supported by postmortem human brain analyses. To study the role of Aβ trimers in vivo, we created a novel bigenic Tg-Aβ+Tau mouse line by crossing Tg2576 (Tg-Aβ) and rTg4510 (Tg-Tau) mice. Before neurodegeneration and amyloidosis, apparent Aβ trimers were increased by ∼2-fold in 3-month-old Tg-Aβ and Tg-Aβ+Tau mice compared with younger mice, whereas soluble monomeric Aβ levels were unchanged. Under these conditions, the expression of soluble Alz50-tau conformers rose by ∼2.2-fold in the forebrains of Tg-Aβ+Tau mice compared with nontransgenic littermates. In parallel, APP accumulated intracellularly, suggestive of a putative dysfunction of anterograde axonal transport. We found that the protein abundance of the kinesin-1 light chain (KLC1) was reduced selectively in vivo and in vitro when soluble Aβ trimers/Alz50-tau were present. Importantly, the reduction in KLC1 was prevented by the intraneuronal delivery of Alz50 antibodies. Collectively, our findings reveal that specific soluble conformers of Aβ and tau cooperatively disrupt axonal transport independently from plaques and tangles. Finally, these results suggest that not all endogenous Aβ oligomers trigger the same deleterious changes and that the role of each assembly should be considered separately. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The mechanistic link between amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, the two major proteins composing the neuropathological lesions detected in brain tissue of Alzheimer's disease subjects, remains unclear. Here, we report that the trimeric Aβ species induce a pathological modification of tau in cultured neurons and in bigenic mice expressing Aβ and human tau. This linkage was also observed in postmortem brain tissue from subjects with mild cognitive impairment, when Aβ trimers are abundant. Further, this modification of tau was associated with the intracellular accumulation of the precursor protein of Aβ, APP, as a result of the selective decrease in kinesin light chain 1 expression.

Autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) has an early symptomatic onset and is caused by single-gene mutations that result in overproduction of β-amyloid 42. To the extent that sporadic late-onset AD (LOAD) also results from dysregulated β-amyloid 42, the clinical phenotypes of ADAD and LOAD should be similar when controlling for the effects of age. OBJECTIVE: To use a family with late-onset ADAD caused by a presenilin 1 (PSEN1) gene mutation to mitigate the potential confound of age when comparing ADAD and LOAD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case-control study was conducted at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center at Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, and other National Institutes of Aging-funded AD centers in the United States. Ten PSEN1 A79V mutation carriers from multiple generations of a family with late-onset ADAD and 12 noncarrier family members were followed up at the Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center (1985-2015) and 1115 individuals with neuropathologically confirmed LOAD were included from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center database (September 2005-December 2014). Data analysis was completed in January 2016, including Knight Alzheimer Disease Research Center patient data collected up until the end of 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Planned comparison of clinical characteristics between cohorts, including age at symptom onset, associated symptoms and signs, rates of progression, and disease duration. RESULTS: Of the PSEN1 A79V carriers in the family with late-onset ADAD, 4 were female (57%); among those with LOAD, 529 were female (47%). Seven mutation carriers (70%) developed AD dementia, while 3 were yet asymptomatic in their seventh and eighth decades of life. No differences were observed between mutation carriers and individuals with LOAD concerning age at symptom onset (mutation carriers: mean, 75 years [range, 63-77 years] vs those with LOAD: mean, 74 years [range, 60-101 years]; P = .29), presenting symptoms (memory loss in 7 of 7 mutation carriers [100%] vs 958 of 1063 individuals with LOAD [90.1%]; P ≥ .99) and duration (mutation carriers: mean, 9.9 years [range, 2.3-12.8 years] vs those with LOAD: 9 years [range, 1-27 years]; P = .73), and rate of progression of dementia (median annualized change in Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes score, mutation carriers: 1.2 [range, 0.1-3.3] vs those with LOAD: 1.9 [range, -3.5 to 11.9]; P = .73). Early emergence of comorbid hallucinations and delusions were observed in 57% of individuals with ADAD (4 of 7) vs 19% of individuals with LOAD (137 of 706) (P = .03). Three of 12 noncarriers (25%) from the PSEN1 A79V family are potential phenocopies as they also developed AD dementia (median age at onset, 76.0 years).

METHODS: Four parkinsonian signs were assessed with a modified motor portion of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in 2,001 older adults without parkinsonism. We used Cox proportional hazards models to determine the associations of age and sex with incident parkinsonism (2 or more signs). We calculated the number of events per 1,000 person-years of observation in 3 age strata. Next, we investigated several potential risk factors for incident parkinsonism. Then, we examined longitudinal progression of parkinsonism using discrete-time multistate Markov models. RESULTS: Average age at baseline was 76.8 years (SD 7.62 years). During an average of 5 years of follow-up, 964/2,001 (48.2%) developed parkinsonism.

METHODS: We repurposed data in which AD-related myeloid proteins CD33, TREM1, TREM2, TREML2, TYROBP, and PTK2B were measured by flow cytometry in monocytes from 176 participants of the PhenoGenetic Project (PGP) and Harvard Aging Brain Study. Linear regression was used to identify associations between 24 PD risk variants and protein expression. The 2 cohorts were meta-analyzed in a discovery analysis, and the 4 most strongly suggestive results were validated in an independent cohort of 50 PGP participants. RESULTS: We discovered and validated an association between the PD risk allele rs12456492(G) in the RIT2 locus and increased CD33 expression (p joint = 3.50 × 10(-5)) and found strongly suggestive evidence that rs11060180(A) in the CCDC62/HIP1R locus decreased PTK2B expression (p joint = 1.12 × 10(-4)). Furthermore, in older individuals, increased CD33 expression on peripheral monocytes was associated with a greater burden of parkinsonism (p = 0.047), particularly bradykinesia (p = 6.64 × 10(-3)). CONCLUSIONS: We find that the rs12456492 PD risk variant affects expression of AD-associated protein CD33 in peripheral monocytes, which suggests that genetic factors for these 2 diseases may converge to influence overlapping innate immune-mediated mechanisms that contribute to neurodegeneration.

Some of these features have now been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we focus on recent studies that have identified robust observations relating to DNA methylation and chromatin in human brain tissue; these findings will ground the next generation of studies and provide a model for the design of such studies. Stemming from observations that compounds with histone deacetylase activity may be beneficial in AD, epigenome-wide studies in cortical samples from large numbers of human subjects have now shown that AD-associated epigenomic changes are reproducible, are not driven by genetic risk factors, and are widespread at specific locations in the genome. A fundamental question of whether such changes are causal remains to be demonstrated, but it is already clear that well-powered investigations of the human epigenome in the target organ of a neurodegenerative disease are feasible, are implicating new areas of the genome in the disease, and will be an important tool for future studies. We are now at an inflection point: as genome-wide association studies of genetic variants come to an end, a new generation of studies exploring the epigenome will provide an important new layer of information with which to enrich our understanding of AD pathogenesis and to possibly guide development of new therapeutic targets.",2016-10,503-514,Acta Neuropathol,PubMed,PMID: 27573688 PMCID: PMC5189639,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27573688,"Alzheimer’s disease; Humans; Animals; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Epigenomics; Aging; DNA methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Chromatin; Histone",

Investigations have shown that antecedent CV risk factors increase the risk for LOAD, although other investigations have failed to validate this association. OBJECTIVE: To study the contribution of CV risk factors (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease) and the history of stroke to LOAD in a data set of large families multiply affected by LOAD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease/National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease family study (hereinafter referred to as NIA-LOAD study) is a longitudinal study of families with multiple members affected with LOAD. A multiethnic community-based longitudinal study (Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project [WHICAP]) was used to replicate findings. The 6553 participants in the NIA-LOAD study were recruited from 23 US Alzheimer disease centers with ongoing data collection since 2003; the 5972 WHICAP participants were recruited at Columbia University with ongoing data collection since 1992. Data analysis was performed from 2003 to 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Generalized mixed logistic regression models tested the association of CV risk factors (primary association) with LOAD. History of stroke was used for the secondary association. A secondary model adjusted for the presence of an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. A genetic risk score, based on common variants associated with LOAD, was used to account for LOAD genetic risk beyond the APOE ε4 effect. Mediation analyses evaluated stroke as a mediating factor between the primary association and LOAD. RESULTS: A total of 6553 NIA-LOAD participants were included in the analyses (4044 women [61.7%]; 2509 men [38.3%]; mean [SD] age, 77.0 [9] years), with 5972 individuals from the WHICAP study included in the replication sample (4072 women [68.2%]; 1900 men [31.8%]; mean [SD] age, 76.5 [7.0] years). Hypertension was associated with decreased LOAD risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55-0.72); type 2 diabetes and heart disease were not. History of stroke conferred greater than 2-fold increased risk for LOAD (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.75-2.83). Adjustment for APOE ε4 did not alter results. The genetic risk score was associated with LOAD (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.05-3.97) but did not change the independent association of LOAD with hypertension or stroke. In the WHICAP sample, hypertension was not associated with LOAD (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.11), whereas history of stroke increased the risk for LOAD (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.56-2.46). The effect of hypertension on LOAD risk was also mediated by stroke in the NIA-LOAD and the WHICAP samples. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In familial and sporadic LOAD, a history of stroke was significantly associated with increased disease risk and mediated the association between selected CV risk factors and LOAD, which appears to be independent of the LOAD-related genetic background.",01/10/2016,1231-1237,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 27533593 PMCID: PMC5155512,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27533593,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; United States; Pedigree; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Hypertension; Age of Onset; Stroke; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Comorbidity; Heart Diseases",

RESULTS: We analyzed blood, saliva, and brain samples from seven different racial/ethnic groups. We assessed the intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration of blood (independent of blood cell counts) and the extrinsic epigenetic aging rates of blood (dependent on blood cell counts and tracks the age of the immune system).

In this study, we investigated the relationship between parkinsonian signs and MAPT transcripts by assessing the effect of MAPT haplotypes on alternative splicing and expression levels of the most common isoforms in two prospective clinicopathologic studies of aging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: using regression analysis, controlling for age, sex, study and neuropathology, we evaluated 976 subjects with clinical, genotyping and brain pathology data for haplotype analysis. For transcript analysis, we obtained MAPT gene and isoform-level expression from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 505 of these subjects. RESULTS: The MAPT H2 haplotype was associated with lower total MAPT expression (p = 1.2x10-14) and global parkinsonism at both study entry (p = 0.001) and proximate to death (p = 0.050). Specifically, haplotype H2 was primarily associated with bradykinesia in both assessments (p<0.001 and p = 0.008). MAPT total expression was associated with age and decreases linearly with advancing age (p<0.001). Analysing MAPT alternative splicing, the expression of 1N/4R isoform was inversely associated with global parkinsonism (p = 0.008) and bradykinesia (p = 0.008). Diminished 1N/4R isoform expression was also associated with H2 (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results suggest that age and H2 are associated with higher parkinsonism score and decreased total MAPT RNA expression. Additionally, we found that H2 and parkinsonism are associated with altered expression levels of specific isoforms.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study analyzed data from the Religious Orders Study (ROS), Memory and Aging Project (MAP), and Adult Changes in Thought study (ACT). All ROS and MAP participants and a subset of ACT participants consent to autopsy. Studies performed annual (ROS and MAP) or biennial (ACT) cognitive and clinical testing to identify incident cases of dementia and AD. The 7130 participants included members of a Seattle-area health care delivery system (ACT), priests and nuns living in orders across the United States (ROS), and Chicago-area adults in retirement communities (MAP). Of these, 1589 underwent autopsy. Primary hypothesis was that TBI with LOC would be associated with increased risk for AD and neurofibrillary tangles. Data were accrued from 1994 to April 1, 2014. EXPOSURES: Self-reported TBI when the participant was free of dementia, categorized as no more than 1 vs more than 1 hour of LOC.

METHODS: This is a postmortem study including 1,017 autopsied participants from 2 clinicopathologic cohorts. Analyses focused on 22 genomic variants associated with AD dementia in large-scale case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses. The neuropathologic traits of interest were a pathologic diagnosis of AD according to NIA-Reagan criteria, macroscopic and microscopic infarcts, Lewy bodies (LB), and hippocampal sclerosis. For each variant, multiple logistic regression was used to investigate its association with neuropathologic traits, adjusting for age, sex, and subpopulation structure. We also conducted power analyses to estimate the sample sizes required to detect genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10(-8)) for pathologic AD for all variants. RESULTS: APOE ε4 allele was associated with greater odds of pathologic AD (odds ratio [OR] 3.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.67-5.46, p = 1.9 × 10(-13)), while ε2 allele was associated with lower odds of pathologic AD (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.30-0.61, p = 3.1 × 10(-6)).

A number of current issues suggest that an unbiased descriptive classification scheme for these biomarkers would be useful. We propose the ""A/T/N"" system in which 7 major AD biomarkers are divided into 3 binary categories based on the nature of the pathophysiology that each measures. ""A"" refers to the value of a β-amyloid biomarker (amyloid PET or CSF Aβ42); ""T,"" the value of a tau biomarker (CSF phospho tau, or tau PET); and ""N,"" biomarkers of neurodegeneration or neuronal injury ([(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, structural MRI, or CSF total tau). Each biomarker category is rated as positive or negative. An individual score might appear as A+/T+/N-, or A+/T-/N-, etc. The A/T/N system includes the new modality tau PET. It is agnostic to the temporal ordering of mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis. It includes all individuals in any population regardless of the mix of biomarker findings and therefore is suited to population studies of cognitive aging. It does not specify disease labels and thus is not a diagnostic classification system. It is a descriptive system for categorizing multidomain biomarker findings at the individual person level in a format that is easy to understand and use. Given the present lack of consensus among AD specialists on terminology across the clinically normal to dementia spectrum, a biomarker classification scheme will have broadest acceptance if it is independent from any one clinically defined diagnostic scheme.",02/08/2016,539-547,Neurology,PubMed,PMID: 27371494 PMCID: PMC4970664,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27371494,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Peptide Fragments; Biomarkers; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Neuroimaging; Nerve Degeneration,

Here, we examined longitudinal changes in cognitive domains in subjects from this cohort grouped by Braak stage using linear mixed effects models. We found that the trajectory of episodic memory composite (EMC), executive function composite (EFC), and global cognitive composite scores (GCS: average of EMC and EFC scores) was significantly associated with age at visit over time, but not with Braak stage, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status or plaque pathology alone.

We constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising common genetic variants associated with AD, evaluated its association with incident AD and assessed its capacity to improve risk prediction over traditional models based on age, sex, education, and APOEɛ4. In eight prospective cohorts included in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), we derived weighted sum of risk alleles from the 19 top SNPs reported by the IGAP GWAS in participants aged 65 and older without prevalent dementia. Hazard ratios (HR) of incident AD were estimated in Cox models. Improvement in risk prediction was measured by the difference in C-index (Δ-C), the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI>0). Overall, 19,687 participants at risk were included, of whom 2,782 developed AD. The GRS was associated with a 17% increase in AD risk (pooled HR = 1.17; 95% CI =   [1.13-1.21] per standard deviation increase in GRS; p-value =  2.86×10-16).

It was hypothesized that neuropsychiatric symptoms and the apolipoprotein E genotype increase the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease development. METHODS: Utilizing data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, information from evaluations of 11,453 cognitively intact participants was analyzed. Survival analysis was used to explore relationships between individual neuropsychiatric symptoms as determined by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, apolipoprotein E, and eventual AD diagnosis. Cox proportional hazard models were utilized to explore the main effects and synergistic (additive and multiplicative) interactions. RESULTS: This study provided evidence for an increased hazard of developing AD among participants with any of the symptoms assessed by the NPI-Q. The hazard of developing AD was almost thirteen times higher for ε4 carriers with delusions and eleven times greater for those with apathy and disinhibition. Statistically significant hazards (p>0.001) were also realized by ε4 carriers with hallucinations; agitation; depression; anxiety; elation; apathy; irritability; and motor, sleep, and appetite disturbances. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that neuropsychiatric symptoms are associated with eventual AD diagnosis among a group of cognitively asymptomatic participants at baseline. Many studies begin with a group of participants already impacted by AD diagnosis. The longitudinal analysis of a group of participants who, at baseline, demonstrated no observable signs of AD was a strength of this study.

Several factors, including genetics, are proposed contributors to variability in muscle strength. To identify genetic contributors to muscle strength, a meta-analysis of genomewide association studies of handgrip was conducted. Grip strength was measured using a handheld dynamometer in 27 581 individuals of European descent over 65 years of age from 14 cohort studies. Genomewide association analysis was conducted on ~2.7 million imputed and genotyped variants (SNPs). Replication of the most significant findings was conducted using data from 6393 individuals from three cohorts. GWAS of lower body strength was also characterized in a subset of cohorts. Two genomewide significant (P-value< 5 × 10(-8) ) and 39 suggestive (P-value< 5 × 10(-5) ) associations were observed from meta-analysis of the discovery cohorts.

This SNP is mapped to an intergenic region and is located within an accessible chromatin region (DNase hypersensitivity site) in skeletal muscle myotubes differentiated from the human skeletal muscle myoblasts cell line. This locus alters a binding motif of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (CEBPB) that is implicated in muscle repair mechanisms. GWAS of lower body strength did not yield significant results.

Neurology,1474-4465,10.1016/S1474-4422(16)30029-1,"BACKGROUND: Few data on the pathology of cerebral vessel disease, dementia, and cognition are available. We examined the association of cerebral atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis neuropathology with probable and possible Alzheimer's disease dementia and cognitive function. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included men and women aged 65 years or older who had yearly clinical assessments and had agreed to brain autopsy at the time of death, as part of one of two cohort studies of ageing (The Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project). Individuals without dementia or with Alzheimer's disease dementia, and with complete neuropathological data, are included in our analyses. We used neuropsychological data proximate to death to create summary measures of global cognition and cognitive domains. Clinical data recorded between 1994 and 2015 were used to determine presence of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Systematic neuropathological assessments documented the severity of cerebral large vessel (atherosclerosis) and small vessel (arteriolosclerosis) disease. By use of regression analyses adjusted for demographics, gross and microscopic infarcts, and Alzheimer's disease pathology, we examined associations of vessel disease severity (mild, moderate, and severe) with odds of probable and possible Alzheimer's disease dementia and cognitive function. FINDINGS: Study enrolment began in January, 1994, and two cohort studies are ongoing. 1143 individuals were included in our analyses (median age at death 88·8 years; 478 [42%] with Alzheimer's disease dementia). Moderate-to-severe atherosclerosis was present in 445 (39%) individuals, and arteriolosclerosis in 401 (35%) individuals. Each level increase in the severity of atherosclerosis or arteriolosclerosis was associated with significantly higher odds of Alzheimer's disease dementia (odds ratio [OR] for atherosclerosis 1·33, 95% CI 1·11-1·58; OR for arteriolosclerosis 1·20, 1·04-1·40). Atherosclerosis was associated with lower scores for global cognition (estimate -0·10 [SE 0·04], p=0·0096) and four cognitive domains (episodic memory -0·10 [0·04], p=0·017; semantic memory -0·11 [0·05], p=0·018; perceptual speed -0·14 [0·04], p=0·00080; and visuospatial abilities -0·13 [0·04], p=0·0080), but not working memory (-0·05 [0·04], p=0·21). Arteriolosclerosis was associated with lower scores for global cognition (estimate -0·10 [0·03], p=0·0015) and four domains (episodic memory -0·12 [0·04], p=0·00090; semantic memory -0·10 [0·04], p=0·013; working memory -0·07 [0·03], p=0·045; perceptual speed -0·12 [0·04], p=0·0012), and a non-significant association was noted for visuospatial abilities (-0·07 [0·03], p=0·052). Findings were unchanged in analyses controlling for the presence of APOE ε4 allele or vascular risk factors.

Cerebral hemispheres were obtained from 425 deceased older adults who had undergone 2 or more annual cognitive assessments, which included clinical diagnosis of dementia. Specimens underwent MRI to produce maps of transverse relaxation rate, R2. Voxelwise regression revealed brain regions where R2 was associated with cognitive decline. We then used random effects models to quantify the extent to which R2 accounted for variation in decline, after adjustment for demographics and neuropathologic indices of the 3 most common causes of dementia: Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, and Lewy body disease. We additionally tested whether R2 was tied to greater likelihood of clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia using logistic regression models. During an average of 8.1 years, the mean rate of decline in global cognitive function was 0.13 unit per year (p < 0.0001). The tissue alteration most commonly related to decline was R2 slowing in white matter. Each unit decrease in R2 was associated with an additional 0.053-unit per year steepening of the rate of global cognitive decline (p < 0.001). Furthermore, R2 accounted for 8.4% of the variance in rate of global cognitive decline, above and beyond the 26.5% accounted for by demographics and neuropathologic indices, and 7.1%-11.2% of the variance of the decline rates in episodic, semantic, and working memory and perceptual speed. Alterations in R2 were also related to an increased odds of clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (odds ratio = 2.000, 95% confidence interval 1.600, 2.604).

The accuracy of inferences, relevance of predictions, and the true nature of the associations made with PRO data depend on the validity of these measures. Errors inherent to self-report measures can seriously bias the estimation of constructs assessed by the scale. A well-documented disadvantage of self-report measures is their sensitivity to response style (RS) effects such as the respondent's tendency to select the extremes of a rating scale. Although the biasing effect of extreme responding on constructs measured by self-reported tools has been widely acknowledged and studied across disciplines, little attention has been given to the development and systematic application of methodologies to assess and control for this effect in PRO measures. METHODS: We review the methodological approaches that have been proposed to study extreme RS effects (ERS). We applied a multidimensional item response theory model to simultaneously estimate and correct for the impact of ERS on trait estimation in a PRO instrument. Model estimates were used to study the biasing effects of ERS on sum scores for individuals with the same amount of the targeted trait but different levels of ERS. We evaluated the effect of joint estimation of multiple scales and ERS on trait estimates and demonstrated the biasing effects of ERS on these trait estimates when used as explanatory variables. RESULTS: A four-dimensional model accounting for ERS bias provided a better fit to the response data. Increasing levels of ERS showed bias in total scores as a function of trait estimates. The effect of ERS was greater when the pattern of extreme responding was the same across multiple scales modeled jointly. The estimated item category intercepts provided evidence of content independent category selection. Uncorrected trait estimates used as explanatory variables in prediction models showed downward bias. CONCLUSIONS: A comprehensive evaluation of the psychometric quality and soundness of PRO assessment measures should incorporate the study of ERS as a potential nuisance dimension affecting the accuracy and validity of scores and the impact of PRO data in clinical research and decision making.",26/05/2016,63,BMC Med Res Methodol,PubMed,PMID: 27229310 PMCID: PMC4882863,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27229310,"Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors; Algorithms; Bias; Risk Assessment; Self Report; Proportional Hazards Models; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Extreme response style; Measurement invariance; Multidimensional item response theory models; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Patient-reported outcomes (PROs); Test validity; Treatment Outcome",

Here, we show that brain nmnat2 mRNA levels correlate positively with global cognitive function and negatively with AD pathology. In AD brains, NMNAT2 mRNA and protein levels are reduced. NMNAT2 shifts its solubility and colocalizes with aggregated Tau in AD brains, similar to chaperones, which aid in the clearance or refolding of misfolded proteins. Investigating the mechanism of this observation, we discover a novel chaperone function of NMNAT2, independent from its enzymatic activity. NMNAT2 complexes with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to refold aggregated protein substrates. NMNAT2's refoldase activity requires a unique C-terminal ATP site, activated in the presence of HSP90. Furthermore, deleting NMNAT2 function increases the vulnerability of cortical neurons to proteotoxic stress and excitotoxicity. Interestingly, NMNAT2 acts as a chaperone to reduce proteotoxic stress, while its enzymatic activity protects neurons from excitotoxicity.

In this study, we determined whether CSF levels of the nerve growth factor (NGF) precursor protein, proNGF, increased during the progression of AD, mirroring its up regulation in postmortem brain samples of people who died with a clinical diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. Immunoblot analysis was performed on ventricular CSF harvested from participants in the Rush Religious Orders Study with an antemortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), amnestic MCI (aMCI, a putative prodromal AD stage), or mild/moderate AD. ProNGF levels were increased 55% in aMCI and 70% in AD compared to NCI. Increasing CSF proNGF levels correlated with impairment on cognitive test scores. In a complementary study, we found that proNGF was significantly increased by 30% in lumbar CSF samples derived from patients with a clinical dementia rating (CDR) of 0.5 or 1 compared to those with a CDR = 0. Notably, proNGF/Aβ1-42 levels were 50% higher in CDR 0.5 and CDR 1 compared to CDR 0 controls.

This association was strongest in individuals with dementia. The level of BDNF expression was lower in individuals with pathologic AD (p = 0.006), but was not associated with macroscopic infarcts, Lewy body disease, or hippocampal sclerosis.

METHODS: Main lifetime occupation information for 7,637 participants aged >65 years of the Chicago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) was linked with standardized data on worker attributes and job characteristics from the Occupational Information Network (O*NET). Ratings of cognitive processes required in 10 work-related tasks were used to create a summary measure of occupational cognitive requirements (possible range 0-7). Multivariable-adjusted linear mixed models were used to estimate the association of occupational cognitive requirements score (OCRS) with cognitive function and rate of cognitive decline. RESULTS: Higher OCRS corresponded to significantly better late-life cognitive performance at baseline in 1993 (p < 0.001) and to slower decline in global cognitive function over time (p = 0.004). Within a genotyped subsample (n = 4,104), the associations of OCRS with rate of cognitive decline did not differ significantly by APOE ε4 carriership (p = 0.11).

Attempts to elucidate the genetic basis of MDD may be hindered by heterogeneity in diagnosis. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale provides a widely used tool for measuring depressive symptoms clustered in four different domains which can be combined together into a total score but also can be analysed as separate symptom domains. METHOD: We performed a meta-analysis of GWAS of the CES-D symptom clusters. We recruited 12 cohorts with the 20- or 10-item CES-D scale (32 528 persons). RESULTS: One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs713224, located near the brain-expressed melatonin receptor (MTNR1A) gene, was associated with the somatic complaints domain of depression symptoms, with borderline genome-wide significance (p discovery = 3.82 × 10-8). The SNP was analysed in an additional five cohorts comprising the replication sample (6813 persons). However, the association was not consistent among the replication sample (p discovery+replication = 1.10 × 10-6) with evidence of heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the effort to harmonize the phenotypes across cohorts and participants, our study is still underpowered to detect consistent association for depression, even by means of symptom classification.

More recently, a growing body of evidence implicates HTN and DM in age-related cognitive decline and risk for dementia, though consensus has yet to be reached on whether older adults living with comorbid HTN and DM are at heightened risk for cognitive impairment. The present study sought to contribute to this topic through a coordinated analysis of 3 longitudinal studies of aging from England, Sweden, and the United States (total N = 12,513). Identical multilevel linear growth models were fit to each to estimate the impact of baseline disease status on initial level and change in verbal declarative memory performance. Overall, few associations between HTN, DM, and cognition were observed. Rate of decline was steeper for Swedish participants with independent HTN but attenuated for their American counterparts. Americans with comorbid HTN and DM showed attenuated decline. Treatment with medication was substantially less prevalent in the earlier-born and lower-educated Swedish sample, which may help to explain our pattern of results. In addition, those living with multiple conditions may be more likely to receive treatment, mitigating cognitive decline. Our results present a nuanced view of the interactions between HTN, DM, and cognition, and lead us to recommend consideration of treatment status or proxies such as birth cohort and education, in combination with age at assessment and specific measure used to interpret research in this area.

There likely are risk variants of higher frequency in AAs that have not been discovered.

Recent large-scale genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than twenty loci that modify risk for AD. Despite the identification of these loci, little progress has been made in identifying the functional variants that explain the association with AD risk. Thus, we sought to determine whether the novel LOAD GWAS single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) alter expression of LOAD GWAS genes and whether expression of these genes is altered in AD brains. The majority of LOAD GWAS SNPs occur in gene dense regions under large linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks, making it unclear which gene(s) are modified by the SNP. Thus, we tested for brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) between LOAD GWAS SNPs and SNPs in high LD with the LOAD GWAS SNPs in all of the genes within the GWAS loci. We found a significant eQTL between rs1476679 and PILRB and GATS, which occurs within the ZCWPW1 locus. PILRB and GATS expression levels, within the ZCWPW1 locus, were also associated with AD status. Rs7120548 was associated with MTCH2 expression, which occurs within the CELF1 locus. Additionally, expression of several genes within the CELF1 locus, including MTCH2, were highly correlated with one another and were associated with AD status. We further demonstrate that PILRB, as well as other genes within the GWAS loci, are most highly expressed in microglia.

They have a small phenotypic correlation (r=-0.11; high body mass index (BMI)-low cognitive function), but whether they have a shared genetic aetiology is unknown. We investigated the phenotypic and genetic correlations between the traits using data from 6815 unrelated, genotyped members of Generation Scotland, an ethnically homogeneous cohort from five sites across Scotland. Genetic correlations were estimated using the following: same-sample bivariate genome-wide complex trait analysis (GCTA)-GREML; independent samples bivariate GCTA-GREML using Generation Scotland for cognitive data and four other samples (n=20 806) for BMI; and bivariate LDSC analysis using the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data on cognitive function (n=48 462) and BMI (n=339 224) to date. The GWAS summary data were also used to create polygenic scores for the two traits, with within- and cross-trait prediction taking place in the independent Generation Scotland cohort. A large genetic correlation of -0.51 (s.e. 0.15) was observed using the same-sample GCTA-GREML approach compared with -0.10 (s.e. 0.08) from the independent-samples GCTA-GREML approach and -0.22 (s.e. 0.03) from the bivariate LDSC analysis. A genetic profile score using cognition-specific genetic variants accounts for 0.08% (P=0.020) of the variance in BMI and a genetic profile score using BMI-specific variants accounts for 0.42% (P=1.9 × 10(-7)) of the variance in cognitive function. Seven common genetic variants are significantly associated with both traits at P<5 × 10(-5), which is significantly more than expected by chance (P=0.007).

We repeated meta-analyses stratified by apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 status, estimated combined odds ratio (OR) and population attributable fraction (cPAF), and explored causal variants. RESULTS: Results support the CLU-MS4A4E interaction and a dominant effect. An association between CLU-MS4A4E and APOE ε4 negative status exists.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of age at menopause and the duration of the reproductive period with the risk for depression among postmenopausal women with naturally occurring menopause. DATA SOURCES: A search strategy for use of MEDLINE was developed (through January 1, 2015) using the key terms menopause, climacteric, reproductive period, depression, and mood disorders. References of included studies and reviews were also screened; authors were contacted to maximize synthesized evidence. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 12,323 articles, without language restriction, were screened by pairs of reviewers to identify observational studies related to the study hypothesis; 14 studies were eligible for meta-analysis. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Pairs of reviewers independently extracted information on study design and type of analysis by participants' characteristics and methods of depression ascertainment. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and fixed- or random-effects models were implemented. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pooled-effect estimates for depression, defined by psychiatric evaluation or validated instruments, by age at menopause and duration of the reproductive period. RESULTS: The 14 studies included in the meta-analysis represented 67,714 women. An inverse association (reported as odds ratio [OR]; 95% CI of 2-year increments) with depression in postmenopausal women was shown for increasing age at menopause (0.98; 0.96-0.99 [67,434 unique participants; 13 studies]) and duration of the reproductive period (0.98; 0.96-0.99 [54,715 unique participants; 5 studies]). Menopause at age 40 or more years compared with premature menopause was associated with a 50% decreased risk for depression (3033 unique participants; 4 studies). Pooling of studies examining severe depression showed a 5% decrease in risk of severe depression with increasing (2-year increment) age at menopause (52,736 unique participants; 3 studies); sensitivity analysis of studies controlling for past depression revealed similar results for age at menopause (0.98; 0.96-1.00 [48,894 unique participants; 3 studies). No heterogeneity or publication bias was evident in the main analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Longer exposure to endogenous estrogens, expressed as older age at menopause and longer reproductive period, is associated with a lower risk of depression in later life.

One potential source for mitochondrial defects could be an imbalance in mitochondrial proteostasis. In this regard, studies indicate that a specialized mitochondrial unfolded protein response (mtUPR) is activated upon the aberrant accumulation of damaged or unfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix, resulting in the up-regulation of key genes involved in mitochondrial stabilization. To test whether mtUPR activation occurs in AD, we performed real-time quantitative PCR on postmortem frontal cortex samples from subjects classified as sporadic AD, familial AD linked to presenilin-1 mutations, or cognitively intact controls. Compared to controls, sporadic AD subjects exhibited a significant ~40-60% increase in expression levels of select genes activated by the mtUPR, including mitochondrial chaperones dnaja3, hspd1, and hspe1, mitochondrial proteases clpp and yme1l1, and txn2, a mitochondrial-specific oxidoreductase. Furthermore, levels of all six mtUPR genes were significantly up-regulated by ~70-90% in familial AD compared to controls, and these expression levels were significantly higher compared to sporadic AD. The increase in hspd1 (Hsp60) was validated by western blotting. These data support the concept that both sporadic and familial AD are characterized by mtUPR gene activation. Understanding the physiological consequences of this response may provide subcellular mechanistic clues to selective neuronal vulnerability or endogenous compensatory mechanisms during the progression of AD.",08/07/2005,610-614,Curr Alzheimer Res,PubMed,PMID: 26687188 PMCID: PMC5977398,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26687188,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Humans; Middle Aged; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Mitochondria; Alzheimer Disease; Frontal Lobe; Mental Status Schedule; Blotting, Western; Family; Genes, Mitochondrial; Transcriptional Activation; Unfolded Protein Response",

METHOD: We separately reviewed two overlapping groups of clinically diagnosed (cAD) AD patients with neuropathology data and neuropathologically definite (npAD) cases (regardless of clinical diagnosis) from the NACC database, and explored the relationships between psychosis and clinical variables, neuropathologic correlates, and vascular risk factors. Delusions and hallucinations, defined according to the NPI-Q, were analyzed separately.

In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, technical replicates of CSF biomarkers are available; the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database contains longitudinal replicates of CSF biomarkers. We focus on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the measure of diagnostic effectiveness for differentiating AD from normal cognition using CSF biomarkers and compare AUC estimates obtained by a more standard, naïve method (which uses a single observation per subject and ignores measurement error) to a maximum likelihood (ML) based method (which uses all replicates per subject and adjusts for measurement error). The choice of analysis method depends upon the noise to signal ratio (i.e., the magnitude of the measurement error variability relative to the true biomarker variability); moderate to high ratios may significantly bias the naïve AUC estimate, and the ML-based method would be preferred. The noise to signal ratios were low for the ADNI biomarkers but high for the tTau and pTau biomarkers in NACC. Correspondingly, the naïve and ML-based AUC estimates were nearly identical in the ADNI data but dissimilar for the tTau and pTau biomarkers in the NACC data.

TBI history was a significant predictor (p <  0.01) and associated with increased odds of MCI diagnosis in unadjusted (OR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.05-1.49) and adjusted models, accounting for age, education, ApoE4, and a composite vascular score (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.10-1.58). This association, however, was largely attenuated (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 0.94-1.37; p = 0.18) after adjustment for reported history of depression. MCI was diagnosed a mean of 2.3 years earlier (p <  0.001) in the TBI+ group, and although TBI+ subjects had an estimated mean of decline 1.7 years earlier, clinician-estimated age of onset failed to differ (p = 0.13) when gender and psychiatric factors were controlled.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: A community-based study recruited from over 40 residential facilities across the metropolitan Chicago area. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling very old adults (n = 1520; mean age 80.2; standard deviation 7.7). MEASUREMENTS: Eleven motor performances were summarized using a composite motor score. All prescription and over the counter medications taken by participants were inspected and coded using the Medi-Span Data Base System. Demographic characteristics and medical history were obtained by means of detailed interview and medical examinations. RESULTS: In multiple linear regression models, antihypertensive medications were associated with global motor score [β = -0.075, standard error (SE) 0.011, P < .001]. Thus, motor function in an individual with antihypertensive medication, was on average, about 7.5% lower than an age-, sex-, and education-matched individual without antihypertensive medication. The number of antihypertensive medications, which were being used had an additive effect, such that a reduction in the level of motor function was observed with each additional medication, and receiving 3 or more antihypertensive medications was associated with about a 15% reduction in the level of motor function. The association between antihypertensive medications and motor function was robust, and remained unchanged after adjusting for confounding by indication using several potentially confounding variables: smoking, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and intermittent claudication (β = -0.05, SE 0.015, P = .001).

One possible explanation for their poorer performance is that the tests used to assess cognition may not reflect the same construct in African Americans and Whites. Therefore, we tested measurement invariance, by race and over time, of a structured 18-test cognitive battery used in three epidemiologic cohort studies of diverse older adults. Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses were carried out with full-information maximum likelihood estimation in all models to capture as much information as was present in the observed data. Four different aspects of the data were fit to each model: comparative fit index (CFI), standardized root mean square residuals (SRMR), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and model $$\chi ^{2} $$ . We found that the most constrained model fit the data well (CFI=0.950; SRMR=0.051; RMSEA=0.057 (90% confidence interval: 0.056, 0.059); the model $$\chi ^{2} $$ =4600.68 on 862 df), supporting the characterization of this model of cognitive test scores as invariant over time and racial group. These results support the conclusion that the cognitive test battery used in the three studies is invariant across race and time and can be used to assess cognition among African Americans and Whites in longitudinal studies. Furthermore, the lower performance of African Americans on these tests is not due to bias in the tests themselves but rather likely reflect differences in social and environmental experiences over the life course.

All individuals were genotyped for ∼50 000 SNPs from 2000 candidate heart, lung, blood and sleep genes. African-Americans had additional genome-wide genotypes. Four cohorts provided replication. A SNP (rs17601612) in the dopamine D2 receptor gene (DRD2) was significantly associated with sleep duration (P = 9.8 × 10(-7)). Conditional analysis identified a second DRD2 signal with opposite effects on sleep duration. In exploratory analysis, suggestive association was observed for rs17601612 with polysomnographically determined sleep latency (P = 0.002). The lead DRD2 signal was recently identified in a schizophrenia GWAS, and a genetic risk score of 11 additional schizophrenia GWAS loci genotyped on the IBC array was also associated with longer sleep duration (P = 0.03).

Highly resistant to proteolysis, this bond can induce protein aggregation and deposition. We set out to determine if tTG may play a role in pathogenesis of AD. Previous studies have shown that tTG and isopeptide are increased in advanced AD, but they have not addressed if this is an early or late feature of AD. In the present study, we measured tTG expression levels and enzyme activity in the brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD, as well as a transgenic mouse model of AD. We found that both enzyme expression and activity were increased in MCI as well as AD compared to NCI. In the transgenic model of AD, tTG expression and enzyme activity increased sharply with age and were relatively specific for the hippocampus. We also assessed overlap of isopeptide immunoreactivity with neurodegeneration-related proteins with Western blots and found neurofilament, tau, and Aβ showed co-localization with isopeptide in both AD and transgenic mice.

We estimated the proportion of older adults with parkinsonism and examined its association with adverse health outcomes and indices of brain pathology. METHODS: Four parkinsonian signs were assessed with the motor portion of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in 2,962 older adults who agreed to annual evaluation and brain autopsy. We used Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association of parkinsonism (two or more signs) and possible parkinsonism (one sign) with adverse health outcomes and regression models in 1,160 decedents to examine the association of parkinsonism and neuropathology. RESULTS: At study entry about 25% (N = 776, 26.2%) had parkinsonism and 30% had possible parkinsonism (N = 885, 29.9%). Parkinsonism was strongly related to age. The frequency was 11.8% for people younger than 75 years, 29.1% for those aged 75-84 years, and 43.7% for those aged 85 years or older. Parkinsonism was associated with an increased hazard of death, of mild cognitive impairment, of Alzheimer's disease and disability. Individuals with possible parkinsonism also had an increased risk for adverse health outcomes compared to individuals without parkinsonism. Postmortem indices of macroscopic and microscopic infarcts, arteriolosclerosis, and atherosclerosis were associated with parkinsonism proximate to death.

METHOD: Older participants (n = 1,965) in 3 longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort studies who had no cognitive impairment at baseline underwent annual clinical evaluations for a mean of 8.0 years (SD = 5.0). The authors defined depression diagnostically, as major depression during the study period, and psychometrically, as elevated depressive symptoms during the study period, and established their relation to cognitive outcomes (incident dementia, rate of cognitive decline). A total of 657 participants died and underwent a uniform neuropathologic examination. The authors estimated the association of depression with 6 dementia-related markers (tau tangles, beta-amyloid plaques, Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, gross and microscopic infarcts) in logistic regression models. RESULTS: In the full cohort, 9.4% were diagnosed with major depression and 8.6% had chronically elevated depressive symptoms, both of which were related to adverse cognitive outcomes. In the 657 persons who died and had a neuropathologic examination, higher beta-amyloid plaque burden was associated with higher likelihood of major depression (present in 11.0%; OR = 1.392, 95% CI = 1.088, 1.780) but not with elevated depressive symptoms (present in 11.3%; OR = 0.919, 95% CI = 0.726, 1.165).

However, years of education may be limited as a CR proxy given that it represents a specific timeframe in early life and is static. Studies suggest that measures of intellectual function provide a dynamic estimate of CR that is superior to years of education since it captures the effect of continued learning over time. The present study determined whether dynamic measures of CR were better predictors of episodic memory and executive function in the presence of AD pathology than a static measure of CR. METHODS: Subjects examined died with a pre-mortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impaired, mild cognitive impairment and mild to moderate AD. CERAD and Braak stage were used to stratify the sample by AD pathology severity. Linear regression analyses using CR by CERAD and CR by Braak stage interaction terms were used to determine whether Extended Range Vocabulary Test (ERVT) scores or years of education were significantly associated with episodic memory composite (EMC) and executive function composite (EFC) performance. All models were adjusted for clinical diagnosis, age at death, gender, APOE e4 carrier status and Braak stage. RESULTS: For episodic memory, years of education by CERAD interaction were not statistically significant (β=-0.01, SE=0.01, p=0.53). By contrast, ERVT interaction with CERAD diagnosis was statistically significant (β=-0.03, SE=0.01, p=0.004). Among the models using Braak stages, none of the CR by pathology interactions were associated with EMC or EFC.

We then used this model system to perform an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study examining 94 genes from loci associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. We found six loci (CD33, PILRB, NUP160, LRRK2, RGS1, and METTL21B) in which the risk haplotype drives the association with both disease susceptibility and altered expression of a nearby gene (cis-eQTL). In the PILRB and LRRK2 loci, the cis-eQTL was found in the MDMi cells but not in human peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting that differentiation of monocytes into microglia-like cells led to the acquisition of a cellular state that could reveal the functional consequences of certain genetic variants. We further validated the effect of risk haplotypes at the protein level for PILRB and CD33, and we confirmed that the CD33 risk haplotype altered phagocytosis by the MDMi cells.

In order to be able to translate the ex-vivo QSM findings to in-vivo, it is crucial to understand the effects of death and chemical fixation on brain magnetic susceptibility measurements collected ex-vivo. Thus, the objective of this work was twofold: a) to assess the behavior of magnetic susceptibility in both gray and white matter of human brain hemispheres as a function of time postmortem, and b) to establish the relationship between in-vivo and ex-vivo gray matter susceptibility measurements on the same hemispheres. Five brain hemispheres from community-dwelling older adults were imaged ex-vivo with QSM on a weekly basis for six weeks postmortem, and the longitudinal behavior of ex-vivo magnetic susceptibility in both gray and white matter was assessed. The relationship between in-vivo and ex-vivo gray matter susceptibility measurements was investigated using QSM data from eleven older adults imaged both antemortem and postmortem. No systematic change in ex-vivo magnetic susceptibility of gray or white matter was observed over time postmortem. Additionally, it was demonstrated that, gray matter magnetic susceptibility measured ex-vivo may be well modeled as a linear function of susceptibility measured in-vivo. In conclusion, magnetic susceptibility in gray and white matter measured ex-vivo with QSM does not systematically change in the first six weeks after death. This information is important for future cross-sectional ex-vivo QSM studies of hemispheres imaged at different postmortem intervals. Furthermore, the linear relationship between in-vivo and ex-vivo gray matter magnetic susceptibility suggests that ex-vivo QSM captures information linked to antemortem gray matter magnetic susceptibility, which is important for translation of ex-vivo QSM findings to in-vivo.",09/07/2005,e0188395,PLoS One,PubMed,PMID: 29261693 PMCID: PMC5737971,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29261693,"Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; White Matter; Brain Mapping; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Gray Matter",

METHODS: We used data from the Canadian Study of Health and Aging from 7569 participants aged 65 years or older who completed a Mini-Mental State Examination at baseline, and at 5 and 10 years later to develop a linear regression model for the Mini-Mental State Examination score as a function of age and education.

The COSU was obtained by summing the confluency over all WMH clusters. COSU was tested for correlation with CERAD-plus subscores.

Aβ, which plays a central role in AD pathogenesis, is generated throughout the brain, yet some regions outside of the limbic and cerebral cortices are relatively spared from Aβ plaque deposition and synapse loss. Here, we examine neurons derived from iPSCs of patients harboring an amyloid precursor protein mutation to quantify AD-relevant phenotypes following directed differentiation to rostral fates of the brain (vulnerable) and caudal fates (relatively spared) in AD. We find that both the generation of Aβ and the responsiveness of TAU to Aβ are affected by neuronal cell type, with rostral neurons being more sensitive than caudal neurons.

Individuals with anxiety may be at a higher risk of the development of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previous literature has suggested that anxiolytic medications may exacerbate the risk of AD development. This study explored anxiolytic medication as a potential moderator of AD risk in older adults. METHODS: A secondary data analysis of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set was undertaken, analyzing observations from 12,083 participants with normal cognition at the first visit. Survival analysis was utilized to examine if anxiolytic medication use by those with anxiety and/or APOE ɛ4 moderates the hazard of AD and/or MCI development. RESULTS: The hazard of probable AD (HR = 3.50, [2.77 - 4.44], p < .0001) or MCI (HR = 2.13, [1.85-2.44], p < .0001) development was statistically significant for those with anxiety. This hazard was no longer statistically significant when specific anxiolytics were used. ɛ4 carriers experienced a statistically significant hazard of AD (HR = 1.92, [1.52-2.41], p < .001) and MCI (HR = 1.17, [1.04-1.32], p < .05) development. This effect was moderated by the use of anxiolytics. DISCUSSION: The results of this study suggest that anxiolytics may moderate the effect of anxiety on MCI and AD development, specifically indicating a neutralized hazard for those with ɛ4 carriers with anxiety.

We aimed to use decline in PCC glucose metabolism as a proxy for the development and progression of AD to discover common genetic variants associated with disease vulnerability. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of decline in PCC fludeoxyglucose F 18 ([18 F] FDG) positron emission tomography measured in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (n = 606). We then performed follow-up analyses to assess the impact of significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on disease risk and longitudinal cognitive performance in a large independent data set (n = 870). Last, we assessed whether significant SNP influence gene expression using two RNA sequencing data sets (n = 210 and n = 159). RESULTS: We demonstrate a novel genome-wide significant association between rs2273647-T in the gene, PPP4R3A, and reduced [18 F] FDG decline (p = 4.44 × 10-8 ). In a follow-up analysis using an independent data set, we demonstrate a protective effect of this variant against risk of conversion to MCI or AD (p = 0.038) and against cognitive decline in individuals who develop dementia (p = 3.41 × 10-15 ). Furthermore, this variant is associated with altered gene expression in peripheral blood and altered PPPP4R3A transcript expression in temporal cortex, suggesting a role at the molecular level. INTERPRETATIONS: PPP4R3A is a gene involved in AD risk and progression. Given the protective effect of this variant, PPP4R3A should be further investigated as a gene of interest in neurodegenerative diseases and as a potential target for AD therapies.

The extent to which individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI) possess serum anti-tau antibodies, and whether their concentrations of these antibodies differ from anti-tau antibody levels in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD, are unclear. Previous studies measuring these antibodies did not account for antibody polyvalent binding, which can be extensive, nor that antibody binding to phosphorylated tau peptides could be due to binding to non-phosphorylated epitopes on those peptides. METHODS: An ELISA controlling for these factors was used to measure the specific binding of serum IgG and IgM to phosphorylated (""pTau;"" phosphorylated at Serine-199 and Serine-202) and non-phosphorylated (""non-pTau"") tau 196-207 in subjects with NCI, MCI, or AD (n = 10/group). Between-group differences in these antibody levels were evaluated for statistical significance, and correlations were examined in pooled data from all subjects between these antibody levels and subject age, global cognitive functioning, and NFT counts. RESULTS: Specific IgG binding to pTau and non-pTau was detected in all subjects except for one NCI control. Specific IgM binding was detected to pTau in all subjects except for two AD patients, and to non-pTau in all subjects. Mean pTau IgG was increased in MCI subjects by 53% and 70% vs. AD and NCI subjects respectively (both p < 0.05), while no significant differences were found between groups for non-pTau IgG (p = 0.052), pTau IgM, or non-pTau IgM. Non-pTau IgG was negatively associated with global cognition (Spearman rho = -0.50). CONCLUSIONS: Specific binding of serum IgG and IgM to phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated tau may be present in older persons regardless of their cognitive status. Serum IgG to phosphorylated tau may be increased in individuals with MCI, but this unexpected finding requires confirmation. The approach used in this study to measure specific serum antibodies to phosphorylated tau should be useful for measuring antibodies to other post-translationally-modified proteins that are of relevance to neurodegenerative disorders.",09/07/2005,32,Transl Neurodegener,PubMed,PMID: 29204273 PMCID: PMC5701435,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29204273,Alzheimer’s disease; Antibodies; Mild cognitive impairment; Elisa ELISA; Phosphorylated tau,

However, the underlying neurobiology of this association is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between brain gene expression, DNA methylation, and alteration of magnetic resonance imaging transverse relaxation in late-life cognitive decline. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data came from 2 community-based longitudinal cohort studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study, which began in 1993, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, which began in 1997. All participants agreed to undergo annual clinical evaluations and to donate their brains after death. By October 24, 2016, a total of 1358 individuals had died and had brain autopsies that were approved by board-certified neuropathologists. Of those, 552 had undergone ex vivo imaging. The gene expression analysis was limited to 174 individuals with both imaging and brain RNA sequencing data. The DNA methylation analysis was limited to 225 individuals with both imaging and brain methylation data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Maps of ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging transverse relaxation were generated using fast spin echo imaging. The target was a composite measure of the transverse relaxation rate (R2) that was associated with cognitive decline after controlling for common neuropathologic conditions. Next-generation RNA sequencing and DNA methylation data were generated using frozen tissue from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Genome-wide association analysis was used to investigate gene expression and, separately, DNA methylation for signals associated with the R2 measure. RESULTS: Of the 552 individuals with ex vivo imaging data, 394 were women and 158 were men, and the mean (SD) age at death was 90.4 (6.0) years.

The association of R2 with cognitive decline was attenuated when the gene expression signals were added to the model, such that the mean (SE) coefficient of association was reduced from 0.028 (0.008) (P < .001) to 0.019 (0.009) (P = .03). The DNA methylation scan did not detect a genome-wide significant signal, but it revealed an anticorrelation between R2 and DNA methylation in many of the cytosine-guanine dinucleotides.

METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was completed in 110 individuals from 31 Caribbean Hispanic families without APOE ε4 homozygous carriers. Rare coding mutations segregating in families were subsequently genotyped in additional families and in an independent cohort of Caribbean Hispanic patients and controls. SRCAP messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was assessed in whole blood from mutation carriers with LOAD, noncarriers with LOAD, and healthy elderly controls, and also from autopsied brains in 2 clinical neuropathologic cohort studies of aging and dementia. RESULTS: Ten ultra-rare missense mutations in the Snf2-related CREBBP, activator protein (SRCAP), were found in 12 unrelated families. Compared with the frequency in Caribbean Hispanic controls and the Latino population in the Exome Aggregation Consortium, the frequency of SRCAP mutations among Caribbean Hispanic patients with LOAD was significantly enriched (p = 1.19e-16). mRNA expression of SRCAP in whole blood was significantly lower in mutation carriers with LOAD, while the expression in whole blood and in the brain was significantly higher in nonmutation carriers with LOAD. Brain expression also correlated with clinical and neuropathologic endophenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: WES in Caribbean Hispanic families with LOAD revealed ultra-rare missense mutations in SRCAP, a gene expressed in the brain and mutated in Floating-Harbor syndrome.

METHODS: Using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Det (NACC-UDS) to identify cohorts of elders with normal cognition (N = 7,663) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, N = 4,114), we compared overall cognitive composite and domain specific sub-scores and their progression over time between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. RESULTS: Diabetes was more common among those with MCI (14.7%) than among subjects who were cognitively normal (11.7%). In subjects who were cognitively normal, baseline cognitive composite scores, attention, and executive function sub-scores were lower in diabetics than non-diabetics (by 0.098, 0.066, and 0.015 points, respectively). Over time, cognitive composite score showed subtle worsening in non-diabetics (0.025 points every 6 months), with an additional worsening of 0.01 points every 6 months in diabetics compared to non-diabetics. In the MCI groups, baseline cognitive composite as well as attention and executive domain sub-scores were lower in diabetics than non-diabetics (by 0.078, 0.092, and 0.032 points, respectively). Over time, cognitive composite (by 0.103 points every 6 months) and all domain specific sub-scores showed subtle worsening in non-diabetics, but diabetics had significantly slower worsening than non-diabetics on both cognitive composite (by 0.028 points) and domain specific sub-scores. DISCUSSION: Among elders, diabetes may be associated with lower cognitive performance, primarily in non-memory domains.

PARTICIPANTS: Research volunteers aged 50 and older with two to six annual visits; 884 were taking PPIs at every visit, 1,925 took PPIs intermittently, and 7,677 never reported taking PPIs. All had baseline normal cognition or MCI. MEASUREMENTS: Multivariable Cox regression analyses evaluated the association between PPI use and annual conversion of baseline normal cognition to MCI or dementia or annual conversion of baseline MCI to dementia, controlling for demographic characteristics, vascular comorbidities, mood, and use of anticholinergics and histamine-2 receptor antagonists. RESULTS: Continuous (always vs never) PPI use was associated with lower risk of decline in cognitive function (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI) =0.66-0.93, P = .005) and lower risk of conversion to MCI or AD (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.69-0.98, P = .03).

METHODS: Of 603 consecutive patients from the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center dataset (FTLD = 350; AD = 253), 120 FTLDs were included in a Rasch analysis to verify CDR-FTLD psychometric properties; 483 (FTLD = 230; AD = 253) were included to analyse disease progression, with 195 (FTLD = 82; AD = 113) followed-up (24 months). RESULTS: The CDR-FTLD demonstrated good consistency, construct and concurrent validity and correlated well with mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and disease duration (ps < 0.05). At baseline, FTLD showed greater dementia severity than AD after matched for MMSE and disease duration (p < 0.001). Independent Rasch analyses demonstrated different patterns of progression for FTLD and AD in terms of the domains initially and then subsequently affected with disease progression.

The load and location of WMHs are important clinical measures that may indicate the presence of small vessel disease in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Manually segmenting WMHs is time consuming and prone to inter-rater and intra-rater variabilities. Automated tools that can accurately and robustly detect these lesions can be used to measure the vascular burden in individuals with AD or the elderly population in general. Many WMH segmentation techniques use a classifier in combination with a set of intensity and location features to segment WMHs, however, the optimal choice of classifier is unknown. METHODS: We compare 10 different linear and nonlinear classification techniques to identify WMHs from MRI data. Each classifier is trained and optimized based on a set of features obtained from co-registered MR images containing spatial location and intensity information. We further assess the performance of the classifiers using different combinations of MRI contrast information. The performances of the different classifiers were compared on three heterogeneous multi-site datasets, including images acquired with different scanners and different scan-parameters. These included data from the ADC study from University of California Davis, the NACC database and the ADNI study. The classifiers (naïve Bayes, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, bagging, and boosting) were evaluated using a variety of voxel-wise and volumetric similarity measures such as Dice Kappa similarity index (SI), Intra-Class Correlation (ICC), and sensitivity as well as computational burden and processing times. These investigations enable meaningful comparisons between the performances of different classifiers to determine the most suitable classifiers for segmentation of WMHs. In the spirit of open-source science, we also make available a fully automated tool for segmentation of WMHs with pre-trained classifiers for all these techniques. RESULTS: Random Forests yielded the best performance among all classifiers with mean Dice Kappa (SI) of 0.66±0.17 and ICC=0.99 for the ADC dataset (using T1w, T2w, PD, and FLAIR scans), SI=0.72±0.10, ICC=0.93 for the NACC dataset (using T1w and FLAIR scans), SI=0.66±0.23, ICC=0.94 for ADNI1 dataset (using T1w, T2w, and PD scans) and SI=0.72±0.19, ICC=0.96 for ADNI2/GO dataset (using T1w and FLAIR scans). Not using the T2w/PD information did not change the performance of the Random Forest classifier (SI=0.66±0.17, ICC=0.99). However, not using FLAIR information in the ADC dataset significantly decreased the Dice Kappa, but the volumetric correlation did not drastically change (SI=0.47±0.21, ICC=0.95). CONCLUSION: Our investigations showed that with appropriate features, most off-the-shelf classifiers are able to accurately detect WMHs in presence of FLAIR scan information, while Random Forests had the best performance across all datasets. However, we observed that the performances of most linear classifiers and some nonlinear classifiers drastically decline in absence of FLAIR information, with Random Forest still retaining the best performance.",15/08/2017,233-249,Neuroimage,PubMed,PMID: 28602597 PMCID: PMC6469398,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28602597,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer's disease; Alzheimer Disease; Aging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; White Matter; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Datasets as Topic; White matter hyperintensities; Classification; Segmentation",

METHODS: We used data from deceased individuals of European descent who participated in the Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (n = 1,288). We examined whether there were associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ±100 kb of the UNC5C gene and a diagnosis of AD dementia, global cognitive decline, a pathologic diagnosis of AD, β-amyloid load, neuritic plaque count, diffuse plaque count, paired helical filament tau density, neurofibrillary tangle count, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) score. We also evaluated the relation of the CAA-associated variant and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) UNC5C RNA expression. Secondary analyses were performed to examine the interaction of the CAA-associated SNP and known genetic risk factors of CAA as well as the association of the SNP with other cerebrovascular pathologies. RESULTS: A set of UNC5C SNPs tagged by rs28660566T was associated with a higher CAA score (p = 2.3 × 10-6): each additional rs28660566T allele was associated with a 0.60 point higher CAA score, which is equivalent to approximately 75% of the higher CAA score associated with each allele of APOE ε4. rs28660566T was weakly associated with lower UNC5C expression in the human DLPFC (p = 0.036).

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate this process are not well understood. Recently, evidence was reported that γ-secretase activating protein (GSAP, 16 kDa), derived from a larger precursor protein (98 kDa), plays a role in Aβ metabolism through a mechanism involving its interaction with both γ-secretase and APP. However, a detailed evaluation of GSAP protein levels and their association with clinical and neuropathological variables are lacking during the clinical progression of Alzheimer disease (AD). METHODS: We quantified levels of the GSAP precursor (98 kDa) and its active form (16 kDa) in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, areas displaying extensive Aβ and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, in subjects who came to autopsy with a premortem clinical diagnosis of noncognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, mild to moderate AD, and severe AD using Western blotting. RESULTS: Analysis found that 98-kDa GSAP levels were increased, while those of 16 kDa were reduced in the frontal cortex of severe-AD subjects. By contrast, GSAP levels remained stable in the hippocampus. Frontal cortex and hippocampal GSAP 98- and 16-kDa levels were not associated with Aβ, NFT, and neuropathological criteria across clinical groups. Interestingly, only neocortical 98-kDa GSAP values showed a significant correlation with the Mini-Mental State Examination and episodic memory scores.

For emerging therapeutics to succeed, determining underlying pathology early in the disease course is increasingly important. Neuropsychological evaluation is an important component of the diagnostic workup for AD and FTD. Patients with FTD are thought to have greater deficits in language and executive function while patients with AD are more likely to have deficits in memory. OBJECTIVES: To determine if performance on initial cognitive testing can reliably distinguish between patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) and AD neuropathology. In addition, are there other factors of the neuropsychological assessment that can be used to enhance the accuracy of underlying pathology? METHODS: Using a logistic regression we retrospectively compared neurocognitive performance on initial evaluation of 106 patients with pathologically verified FTLD (pvFTLD), with 558 pathologically verified AD (pvAD) patients from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center using data from the Uniform Data Set (UDS) and the neuropathology data set. RESULTS: As expected, pvFTLD patients were younger, demonstrated better memory performance, and had more neuropsychiatric symptoms than pvAD patients. Other results were less predictable: pvFTLD patients performed better on one test of executive function (trail making test part B) but worse on another (digit span backward). Performance on language testing did not strongly distinguish the 2 groups. To determine what factors led to a misdiagnosis of AD in patients with FTLD, we further analyzed a small group of pvFTLD patients. These patients demonstrated older age and lower Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire counts compared with accurately diagnosed cases. CONCLUSIONS: Other than memory, numerical scores of neurocognitive performance on the UDS are of limited value in differentiating FTLD from AD at the initial visit. These results highlight the difficulty of obtaining an accurate early diagnosis of FTLD and argue for adding supplemental tests to those included in the UDS to assess cognition in FTD and AD patients.",09/07/2005,187-191,Alzheimer Dis Assoc Disord,PubMed,PMID: 28005562 PMCID: PMC5479762,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28005562,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Neuropsychological Tests; Retrospective Studies; Frontotemporal Dementia; Databases, Factual; Diagnosis, Differential",

Additionally, we identify one new miRNA (miR-99) and four lincRNA that are associated with these traits. Many other previously reported associations of microRNA with AD are associated with the confounders quantified in our longitudinal cohort. Finally, by performing analyses integrating both miRNA and RNA sequence data from the same individuals (525 samples), we characterize the impact of AD associated miRNA on human brain expression: we show that the effects of miR-132 and miR-129-5b converge on certain genes such as EP300 and find a role for miR200 and its target genes in AD using an integrated miRNA/mRNA analysis.

In two unrelated cohorts, we identified pathway-enriched facilitation of lipid processing and alternative splicing genes, including the neuronal-enriched NOVA1 and hnRNPA1. Specifically, this association emerged in temporal lobe tissue samples from donors where postmortem evidence demonstrated AD neuropathology, but who presented normal cognition proximate to death. The observed changes further associated with modified ATP synthesis and mitochondrial transcripts, indicating metabolic relevance; accordingly, mass-spectrometry-derived lipidomic profiles distinguished between individuals with and without cognitive impairment prior to death. In spite of the limited group sizes, tissues from persons with both cognitive impairment and AD pathology showed elevation in several drug-targeted genes of other brain, vascular and autoimmune disorders, accompanied by pathology-related increases in distinct lipid processing transcripts, and in the RNA metabolism genes hnRNPH2, TARDBP, CLP1 and EWSR1. To further detect 3'-polyadenylation variants, we employed multiple cDNA primer pairs. This identified variants that showed limited differences in scope and length between the tested cohorts, yet enabled superior clustering of demented and non-demented AD brains versus controls compared to total mRNA expression values.

Participants who died underwent a uniform neuropathologic examination to quantify common dementia-related pathologies. Some psychosocial indicators were associated with cerebral infarction; some indicators modified the association of neurodegenerative pathologies with cognitive loss; and the association of some indicators with cognitive outcomes appears to be independent of the pathologies traditionally associated with late-life dementia.

Here, we found an abnormal accumulation of oligomeric αSyn species in AD brains by custom ELISA, size-exclusion chromatography, and nondenaturing/denaturing immunoblotting techniques. Importantly, the abundance of αSyn oligomers in human brain tissue correlated with cognitive impairment and reductions in synapsin expression. By overexpressing WT human αSyn in an AD mouse model, we artificially enhanced αSyn oligomerization. These bigenic mice displayed exacerbated Aβ-induced cognitive deficits and a selective decrease in synapsins. Following isolation of various soluble αSyn assemblies from transgenic mice, we found that in vitro delivery of exogenous oligomeric αSyn but not monomeric αSyn was causing a lowering in synapsin-I/II protein abundance. For a particular αSyn oligomer, these changes were either dependent or independent on endogenous αSyn expression. Finally, at a molecular level, the expression of synapsin genes SYN1 and SYN2 was down-regulated in vivo and in vitro by αSyn oligomers, which decreased two transcription factors, cAMP response element binding and Nurr1, controlling synapsin gene promoter activity.

Genetic studies using intermediate quantitative traits such as biomarkers, or endophenotypes, benefit from increased statistical power to identify variants that may not pass the stringent multiple test correction in case-control studies. Endophenotypes also contain additional information helpful for identifying variants and genes associated with other aspects of disease, such as rate of progression or onset, and provide context to interpret the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted GWAS of amyloid beta (Aβ42), tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau181) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 3146 participants across nine studies to identify novel variants associated with AD. Five genome-wide significant loci (two novel) were associated with ptau181, including loci that have also been associated with AD risk or brain-related phenotypes. Two novel loci associated with Aβ42 near GLIS1 on 1p32.3 (β = -0.059, P = 2.08 × 10-8) and within SERPINB1 on 6p25 (β = -0.025, P = 1.72 × 10-8) were also associated with AD risk (GLIS1: OR = 1.105, P = 3.43 × 10-2), disease progression (GLIS1: β = 0.277, P = 1.92 × 10-2), and age at onset (SERPINB1: β = 0.043, P = 4.62 × 10-3). Bioinformatics indicate that the intronic SERPINB1 variant (rs316341) affects expression of SERPINB1 in various tissues, including the hippocampus, suggesting that SERPINB1 influences AD through an Aβ-associated mechanism. Analyses of known AD risk loci suggest CLU and FERMT2 may influence CSF Aβ42 (P = 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively) and the INPP5D locus may affect ptau181 levels (P = 0.009); larger studies are necessary to verify these results.

OBJECTIVE: To gain a better understanding of the factors that affect the natural history of progression in Alzheimer disease for the purpose of improving both clinical care and clinical trial design. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A longitudinal cohort study of aging from 2005 to 2014 in the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center. Clinical evaluation of the participants was conducted in 31 National Institute on Aging's Alzheimer Disease Centers. Nine hundred eighty-four participants in the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center cohort study who died and underwent autopsy and met inclusion and exclusion criteria. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: We sought to model the possibility that knowledge of neurofibrillary tangle burden in the presence of moderate or frequent plaques would add to the ability to predict clinical rate of progression during the ensuing 2 to 3 years. We examined the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center autopsy data to evaluate the effect of different neurofibrillary tangle stages on the rates of progression on several standard clinical instruments: the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes, a verbal memory test (logical memory), and a controlled oral word association task (vegetable naming), implementing a reverse-time longitudinal modeling approach in conjunction with latent class estimation to adjust for unmeasured sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: Several correlations between clinical variables and neurocognitive performance suggest a basis for heterogeneity: Higher education level was associated with lower Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (β = -0.19; P < .001), and frequent vs moderate neuritic plaques were associated with higher Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes (β = 1.64; P < .001) and lower logical memory score (β = -1.07; P = .005). The rate of change of the clinical and cognitive scores varied depending on Braak stage, when adjusting for plaques, age of death, sex, education, and APOE genotype. For example, comparing high vs low Braak stage with other variables fixed, the logical memory score decreased a substantial 0.38 additional units per year (95% CI, -0.70 to -0.06; P = .02). Using these data, we estimate that a 300-participant clinical trial with end point of a 20% improvement in slope in rate of change of Clinical Dementia Rating Scale sum of boxes has 89% power when all participants in the trial are from the high Braak stage, compared with 29% power if Braak stage had not used for eligibility. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We found that knowledge of neurofibrillary tangle stage, modeled as the sort of information that could be available from tau positron-emission tomography scans and its use to determine eligibility to a trial, could dramatically improve the power of clinical trials and equivalently reduce the required sample sizes of clinical trials.",01/05/2017,540-548,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 28288263 PMCID: PMC5547572,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28288263,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Clinical Trials as Topic; Prognosis; Research Design; Alzheimer Disease; Longitudinal Studies; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Disease Progression; Autopsy; Models, Statistical",

METHOD: There are 46,146 total Logical Memory administrations to participants diagnosed with either Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), or normal cognition in the National Alzheimer's Disease Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set. RESULTS: Only 50% of the sample was administered the standard 20-35 min of delay as specified by WMS-R and WMS-III. We found a significant effect of delay time duration on proportion of information retained for the VaD group compared to its control group, which remained after adding LMI raw score as a covariate. There was poorer retention of information with longer delay for this group. This association was not as strong for the AD and cognitively normal groups. A 24.5-min delay was most optimal for differentiating AD from VaD participants (47.7% classification accuracy), an 18.5-min delay was most optimal for differentiating AD versus normal participants (51.7% classification accuracy), and a 22.5-min delay was most optimal for differentiating VaD versus normal participants (52.9% classification accuracy). CONCLUSIONS: Considering diagnostic implications, our findings suggest that test administration should incorporate precise tracking of delay periods. We recommend a 20-min delay with 18-25-min range.

We tested whether RGCC levels were dysregulated in frontal cortex samples obtained postmortem from subjects who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), MCI, or AD. RGCC mRNA and protein levels were upregulated by ∼50%-60% in MCI and AD compared to NCI, and RGCC protein levels were associated with poorer antemortem global cognitive performance in the subjects examined. To test whether RGCC might regulate neuronal cell cycle reentry and apoptosis, we differentiated neuronotypic PC12 cultures with nerve growth factor (NGF) followed by NGF withdrawal to induce abortive cell cycle activation and cell death.

Generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by β-amyloid has also been implicated in AD pathogenesis. However, it is unclear whether ROS contributes to synaptic dysfunction seen in AD pathogenesis and, therefore, we examined whether altered redox signaling could contribute to synaptic deficits in AD. RESULTS: Activity dependent but not basal translation was impaired in synaptoneurosomes from 1-month old presymptomatic APPSwe/PS1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) mice, and this deficit was sustained till middle age (MA, 9-10 months). ROS generation leads to oxidative modification of Akt1 in the synapse and consequent reduction in Akt1-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, leading to deficiency in activity-dependent protein translation. Moreover, we found a similar loss of activity-dependent protein translation in synaptoneurosomes from postmortem AD brains. INNOVATION: Loss of activity-dependent protein translation occurs presymptomatically early in the pathogenesis of AD. This is caused by ROS-mediated loss of pAkt1, leading to reduced synaptic Akt1-mTOR signaling and is rescued by overexpression of Akt1. ROS-mediated damage is restricted to the synaptosomes, indicating selectivity. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that ROS-mediated oxidative modification of Akt1 contributes to synaptic dysfunction in AD, seen as loss of activity-dependent protein translation that is essential for synaptic plasticity and maintenance. Therapeutic strategies promoting Akt1-mTOR signaling at synapses may provide novel target(s) for disease-modifying therapy in AD. Antioxid.

METHODS AND FINDINGS: ""Residual cognition"" was quantified by regressing out the effects of cerebral pathologies and demographic characteristics on global cognitive performance proximate to death. To identify genes influencing residual cognition, we leveraged neuropathological, genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data available for deceased participants of the Religious Orders Study (n = 492) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (n = 487). Given that our sample size was underpowered to detect genome-wide significance, we applied a multistep approach to identify genes influencing residual cognition, based on our prior observation that independent genetic and epigenetic risk factors can converge on the same locus. In the first step (n = 979), we performed a genome-wide association study with a predefined suggestive p < 10-5, and nine independent loci met this threshold in eight distinct chromosomal regions. Three of the six genes within 100 kb of the lead SNP are expressed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC): UNC5C, ENC1, and TMEM106B. In the second step, in the subset of participants with DLPFC DNA methylation data (n = 648), we found that residual cognition was related to differential DNA methylation of UNC5C and ENC1 (false discovery rate < 0.05). In the third step, in the subset of participants with DLPFC RNA sequencing data (n = 469), brain transcription levels of UNC5C and ENC1 were evaluated for their association with residual cognition: RNA levels of both UNC5C (estimated effect = -0.40, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.10, p = 0.0089) and ENC1 (estimated effect = 0.0064, 95% CI 0.0033 to 0.0096, p = 5.7 × 10-5) were associated with residual cognition. In secondary analyses, we explored the mechanism of these associations and found that ENC1 may be related to the previously documented effect of depression on cognitive decline, while UNC5C may alter the composition of presynaptic terminals. Of note, the TMEM106B allele identified in the first step as being associated with better residual cognition is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1990622A (r2 = 0.66), a previously identified protective allele for TDP-43 proteinopathy. Limitations include the small sample size for the genetic analysis, which was underpowered to detect genome-wide significance, the evaluation being limited to a single cortical region for epigenetic and transcriptomic data, and the use of categorical measures for certain non-amyloid-plaque, non-neurofibrillary-tangle neuropathologies. CONCLUSIONS: Through a multistep analysis of cognitive, neuropathological, genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data, we identified ENC1 and UNC5C as genes with convergent genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic evidence supporting a potential role in the dissociation of cognition and neuropathology in an aging population, and we expanded our understanding of the TMEM106B haplotype that is protective against TDP-43 proteinopathy.",2017-04,e1002287,PLoS Med,PubMed,PMID: 28441426 PMCID: PMC5404753,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28441426,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Alleles; Genotype; RNA; Microfilament Proteins; Membrane Proteins; Receptors, Cell Surface; Genome-Wide Association Study; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Aging; Memory; Linkage Disequilibrium; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Nerve Tissue Proteins; TDP-43 Proteinopathies; Cognition Disorders; Depression; Nuclear Proteins; Neuropeptides; Netrin Receptors",

MCI is rapidly increasing among older adults in general and has not yet been examined in older adults within the Appalachian region.

METHODS: A cross-sectional, descriptive study of older Appalachian adults with MCI was conducted using data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set. Symptom severity was conceptualized as neuropsychological composite scores across 4 cognitive domains and Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB) score. For group comparisons, MANCOVA was used for cognitive domains and ANCOVA for CDR-SOB. RESULTS: The sample (N = 289) was about half male (54.3%), predominantly white (91.7%), and living with others (83.5%), with a mean (±SD) 74.6 ± 6.2 years of age and 15.4 ± 3.0 years of education.

Rural and urban participants were similar across the 4 cognitive domains and CDR-SOB (P ≥ .05).

Data came from 567 post-mortem brains donated by participants in two cohort studies of aging and dementia. R2 was quantified using fast spin echo imaging. Voxelwise linear regression examined R2 alterations between subjects diagnosed with AD dementia at death and those with no cognitive impairment. Voxels showing significant R2 alterations were clustered into regions of interest (ROIs). Three R2 profiles were compared, which were adjusted for (1) demographics only; (2) demographics and AD pathology; (3) demographics, AD pathology and other common neuropathologies. R2 alterations were observed throughout the hemisphere, most commonly in white matter. Of the distinct ROIs identified, the largest region encompassed large portions of white matter in all lobes. This ROI became smaller in size but remained largely intact after adjusting for AD and other neuropathologic indices.

Although genetic studies have identified AD-associated SNPs in APOE and other genes, genetic information has not been integrated into an epidemiological framework for risk prediction. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using genotype data from 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP Stage 1), we identified AD-associated SNPs (at p < 10-5). We then integrated these AD-associated SNPs into a Cox proportional hazard model using genotype data from a subset of 6,409 AD patients and 9,386 older controls from Phase 1 of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), providing a polygenic hazard score (PHS) for each participant. By combining population-based incidence rates and the genotype-derived PHS for each individual, we derived estimates of instantaneous risk for developing AD, based on genotype and age, and tested replication in multiple independent cohorts (ADGC Phase 2, National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Center [NIA ADC], and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], total n = 20,680). Within the ADGC Phase 1 cohort, individuals in the highest PHS quartile developed AD at a considerably lower age and had the highest yearly AD incidence rate. Among APOE ε3/3 individuals, the PHS modified expected age of AD onset by more than 10 y between the lowest and highest deciles (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% CI 2.62-4.24, p = 1.0 × 10-22). In independent cohorts, the PHS strongly predicted empirical age of AD onset (ADGC Phase 2, r = 0.90, p = 1.1 × 10-26) and longitudinal progression from normal aging to AD (NIA ADC, Cochran-Armitage trend test, p = 1.5 × 10-10), and was associated with neuropathology (NIA ADC, Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangles, p = 3.9 × 10-6, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score for neuritic plaques, p = 6.8 × 10-6) and in vivo markers of AD neurodegeneration (ADNI, volume loss within the entorhinal cortex, p = 6.3 × 10-6, and hippocampus, p = 7.9 × 10-5). Additional prospective validation of these results in non-US, non-white, and prospective community-based cohorts is necessary before clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a PHS for quantifying individual differences in age-specific genetic risk for AD. Within the cohorts studied here, polygenic architecture plays an important role in modifying AD risk beyond APOE. With thorough validation, quantification of inherited genetic variation may prove useful for stratifying AD risk and as an enrichment strategy in therapeutic trials.",2017-03,e1002258,PLoS Med,PubMed,PMID: 28323831 PMCID: PMC5360219,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323831,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genotype; United States; Alzheimer Disease; Longitudinal Studies; Apolipoproteins E; Multifactorial Inheritance; Geriatric Assessment",

METHODS: We obtained 3-year longitudinal data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set for patients with a baseline diagnosis of MCI. To predict MCI stability, we used the patients' baseline data to conduct three logistic regression models: demographics, global function, and neuropsychological performance. RESULTS: Our final sample had 1059 patients. At the end of 3 years, 596 still had MCI and 463 had converted to dementia. The most reliable predictors of stable MCI were higher baseline scores on delayed recall, processing speed, and global function; younger age; and absence of apolipoprotein E4 alleles. CONCLUSIONS: Not all patients with MCI progress to dementia.

METHODS: Data were drawn from a large autopsy series (N = 1,337) of individuals followed longitudinally from normal or MCI status to death, derived from 4 Alzheimer Disease (AD) Centers in the United States. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 7.9 years. Of the 874 individuals ever diagnosed with MCI, final clinical diagnoses were varied: 39.2% died with an MCI diagnosis, 46.8% with a dementia diagnosis, and 13.9% with a diagnosis of intact cognition. The latter group had pathological features resembling those with a final clinical diagnosis of MCI. In terms of non-AD pathologies, both primary age-related tauopathy (p < 0.05) and brain arteriolosclerosis pathology (p < 0.001) were more severe in MCI than cognitively intact controls. Among the group that remained MCI until death, mixed AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC; ≥1 comorbid pathology) were more frequent than ""pure"" ADNC pathology (55% vs 22%); suspected non-Alzheimer pathology comprised the remaining 22% of cases. A majority (74%) of subjects who died with MCI were without ""high""-level ADNC, Lewy body disease, or hippocampal sclerosis pathologies; this group was enriched in cerebrovascular pathologies. Subjects who died with dementia and were without severe neurodegenerative pathologies tended to have cerebrovascular pathology and carry the MCI diagnosis for a longer interval.

Significant emerging evidence has linked cholesterol, β-amyloid and AD, and several studies have shown a reduced risk for AD and dementia in populations treated with statins. However, while some clinical trials evaluating statins in general AD populations have been conducted, these resulted in no significant therapeutic benefit. By focusing on subgroups of the AD population, it may be possible to detect endotypes responsive to statin therapy. METHODS: Here we investigate the possible protective and therapeutic effect of statins in AD through the analysis of datasets of integrated clinical trials, and prospective observational studies. RESULTS: Re-analysis of AD patient-level data from failed clinical trials suggested by trend that use of simvastatin may slow the progression of cognitive decline, and to a greater extent in ApoE4 homozygotes. Evaluation of continual long-term use of various statins, in participants from multiple studies at baseline, revealed better cognitive performance in statin users. These findings were supported in an additional, observational cohort where the incidence of AD was significantly lower in statin users, and ApoE4/ApoE4-genotyped AD patients treated with statins showed better cognitive function over the course of 10-year follow-up.

METHODS: Data came from participants in 2 cohort studies of aging and dementia who underwent annual clinical evaluations for up to 21 years. APOE and TOMM40'523 genotypes were determined from DNA from blood or brain samples. Linear mixed models compared the rates of decline in cognition among APOE ε3/3 carriers with different '523 genotypes. RESULTS: The 1,170 APOE ε3/3 homozygotes were of European ancestry, were free of dementia at baseline, and had an average age of 78.5 years at baseline.

Previous studies have demonstrated that cognitively normal individuals with higher dispersion are at an increased risk for progressing to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, we determined 1) whether increased dispersion in older adults was associated with amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and 2) whether increased cognitive dispersion accurately differentiated MCI and AD from non-cognitively impaired (NCI) individuals. The intra-subject standard deviation (ISD) was used to quantify cognitive dispersion, and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis determined whether ISD differentiated MCI and AD from NCI. Neuropathological scores for diffuse plaques (DPs), neuritic plaques (NPs), and NFTs were used as outcome measures in a series of negative binomial regression models.

Overall, the strongest negative correlation coefficients associated with global cognitive scores were obtained for insoluble phosphorylated tau (r2 = -0.484), insoluble Aβ42 (r2 = -0.389) and neurofibrillary tangle counts (r2 = -0.494) (all p < 0.001). Robust inverse associations with cognition scores were also established for TDP-43-positive cytoplasmic inclusions (r2 = -0.476), total insoluble tau (r2 = -0.385) and Aβ plaque counts (r2 = -0.426). Sarkosyl (SK)- or formic acid (FA)-extracted tau showed similar interrelations.

However, the extent to which the LC projection system degenerates during the initial stages of AD is still under investigation. To address this question, we performed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry and unbiased stereology of noradrenergic LC neurons in tissue harvested postmortem from subjects who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI, a putative prodromal AD stage), or mild/moderate AD. Stereologic estimates of total LC neuron number revealed a 30% loss during the transition from NCI to aMCI, with an additional 25% loss of LC neurons in AD. Decreases in noradrenergic LC neuron number were significantly associated with worsening antemortem global cognitive function as well as poorer performance on neuropsychological tests of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability. Reduced LC neuron numbers were also associated with increased postmortem neuropathology. To examine the cellular and molecular pathogenic processes underlying LC neurodegeneration in aMCI, we performed single population microarray analysis. These studies revealed significant reductions in select functional classes of mRNAs regulating mitochondrial respiration, redox homeostasis, and neuritic structural plasticity in neurons accessed from both aMCI and AD subjects compared to NCI. Specific gene expression levels within these functional classes were also associated with global cognitive deterioration and neuropathological burden. Taken together, these observations suggest that noradrenergic LC cellular and molecular pathology is a prominent feature of prodromal disease that contributes to cognitive dysfunction. Moreover, they lend support to a rational basis for targeting LC neuroprotection as a disease modifying strategy.",21/01/2017,8,Acta Neuropathol Commun,PubMed,PMID: 28109312 PMCID: PMC5251221,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28109312,"Alzheimer’s disease; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; RNA, Messenger; Gene Expression; Alzheimer Disease; Longitudinal Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Progression; Neurons; Neuropsychological Tests; Mild cognitive impairment; Neurodegeneration; Immunohistochemistry; Microarray Analysis; Gene expression; Cell Count; Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase; Locus coeruleus; Locus Coeruleus; Norepinephrine",

ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) is a placebo-controlled trial of low-dose aspirin that will determine whether 5 years of daily 100-mg enteric-coated aspirin extends disability-free and dementia-free life in a healthy elderly population and whether these benefits outweigh the risks. METHODS: Set in primary care, this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial has a composite primary endpoint of death, incident dementia or persistent physical disability. Participants aged 70+ years (non-minorities) or 65+ years (U.S. minorities) were free of cardiovascular disease, dementia, or physical disability and without a contraindication to, or indication for, aspirin. Baseline data include physical and lifestyle, personal and family medical history, hemoglobin, fasting glucose, creatinine, lipid panel, urinary albumin:creatinine ratio, cognition (3MS, HVLT-R, COWAT, SDMT), mood (CES-D-10), physical function (gait speed, grip strength), Katz activities of daily living and quality of life (SF-12). RESULTS: Recruitment ended in December 2014 with 16,703 Australian and 2,411 U.S. participants, a median age of 74 (range 65-98) years and 56% women. Approximately 55% of the U.S. cohort were from minority groups; 9% of the total cohort. Proportions with hypertension, overweight, and chronic kidney disease were similar to age-matched populations from both countries although lower percentages had diabetes, dyslipidemia, and osteoarthritis.

To identify the genetic underpinnings of hippocampal structure here we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 33,536 individuals and discover six independent loci significantly associated with hippocampal volume, four of them novel. Of the novel loci, three lie within genes (ASTN2, DPP4 and MAST4) and one is found 200 kb upstream of SHH. A hippocampal subfield analysis shows that a locus within the MSRB3 gene shows evidence of a localized effect along the dentate gyrus, subiculum, CA1 and fissure. Further, we show that genetic variants associated with decreased hippocampal volume are also associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (rg=-0.155).

METHODS: Of 1,058 autopsied participants, 343 (32.4%) did not have pathologic diagnoses of AD or FTLD. Diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical evaluation and cognitive performance tests, which were used to create summary measures of global cognition and of 5 cognitive domains. TDP-43 pathology evaluated in 6 brain regions by immunohistochemistry was converted into a summary measure of TDP-43 severity. RESULTS: Of 343 participants, 135 (39.4%) had TDP-43 pathology with a mean TDP-43 severity score of 0.394 (SD 0.490). TDP-43 inclusions were confined to the amygdala (stage 1) in 43.7% of participants, 40% showed additional involvement of the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex (stages 2), while fewer (16.3%) showed additional TDP-43 pathology in the temporal and frontal cortices (stage 3). Severity of TDP-43 pathology was independently related to lower function in global cognition and episodic and semantic memory while increased odds of dementia was only a trend. When participants with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) were excluded from the models, TDP-43 pathology remained associated with lower episodic memory but relationships with global cognition, semantic memory, and dementia were attenuated.

Participants were 1096 deceased persons from two clinical-pathologic studies. All were without dementia at baseline, completed a detailed battery of cognitive tests annually over up to 21 years, died, and underwent detailed neuropathologic examinations to identify Alzheimer's disease pathology, vascular pathologies (i.e. macro- and microscopic infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolar sclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy), Lewy bodies, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, and hippocampal sclerosis. A time-varying effects model was used to flexibly characterize the trajectory of global cognition and assess whether the effects of demographics and each neuropathologic index on cognition changed over time. Results indicated that the mean trajectory of global cognition was characterized by gradual cognitive decline beginning ∼15 years before death and accelerated decline in the last few years. With the exception of microinfarcts and arteriolar sclerosis, all neuropathologies were associated with the cognitive trajectory. However, the nature of their associations varied. Alzheimer's disease pathology, macroscopic infarcts, Lewy bodies, TDP-43 pathology, and hippocampal sclerosis were associated with progressive cognitive decline, with their deleterious effects increasing over time. By contrast, atherosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy pathology were associated with a lower level of cognition but their effects were relatively stable over time.

However, few community-based studies have explored the relationship between perceived stress and cognitive decline, and fewer still have utilized cognitive domains rather than a global measure of cognition. OBJECTIVE: We examined the relation between perceived stress and the rate of decline in different cognitive domains. METHODS: Participants were older African Americans without dementia from the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS; N = 467, mean age: 73 years, SD: 6.1 years). A battery of 19 cognitive tests was administered at baseline and at annual intervals for up to 9 years (mean follow-up: 4 years), from which composite measures of global cognitive function and five specific cognitive domains were derived. The four-item Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) was also administered at baseline. RESULTS: In linear mixed-effects models adjusted for age, sex, education, and vascular risk factors, higher perceived stress was related to faster declines in global cognition (β = -0.019; SE: 0.008; t(1951) = -2.46), episodic memory (β = -0.022; SE: 0.011; t(1954) = -1.99), and visuospatial ability (β = -0.021; SE: 0.009; t(1939) = -2.38) all p < 0.05.

The combinatorial use of biomarkers derived from biological fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with advanced molecular imaging and neuropsychological testing may eventually achieve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity necessary to identify people in the earliest stages of the disease when drug modification is most likely possible. In this regard, positive amyloid or tau tracer retention on positron emission tomography imaging, low CSF concentrations of the amyloid-β 1-42 peptide, high CSF concentrations in total tau and phospho-tau, mesial temporal lobe atrophy on magnetic resonance imaging, and temporoparietal/precuneus hypometabolism or hypoperfusion on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography have all emerged as biomarkers for the progression to AD.

METHOD: Participants with a clinical diagnosis of AD (n = 7625) were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set, and categorized based on self-reported lifetime TBI with loss of consciousness (LOC) (TBI+ vs. TBI-) and presence of Apoe4. ANCOVAs, controlling for gender, race, and education were used to examine the association between history of TBI, presence of Apoe4, and an interaction of both risk factors on estimated age of AD onset. RESULTS: Estimated AD onset differed by TBI history and Apoe4 independently (p's < .001). The TBI+ group had a mean age of onset 2.5 years earlier than the TBI- group. Likewise, Apoe4 carriers had a mean age of onset 2.3 years earlier than non-carriers.

RESULTS: Compared with the reference and the 140-149 mmHg groups, those with BP ≥150 mmHg exhibited poorer cognitive status by Year 4 on the Mini-Mental State Exam, and they had a higher risk of conversion to MCI. The 140-149 mmHg exhibited poorer performance than the reference group on domains assessing attention and executive functioning. In contrast, their performance was not significantly different from those with BP ≥150 mmHg. CONCLUSIONS: Persons with BP ≥150 mmHg show a faster global cognitive decline and transition to MCI than those with lower BP readings. However, the poor cognitive performance in the attention and executive functioning domains for the 140-149 mmHg group indicates the need for further research evaluating the newer recommended cutoff.",2017-01,121-126,J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,PubMed,PMID: 27678289 PMCID: PMC5155663,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27678289,Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Cognitive Dysfunction; Older adults; Hypertension; Executive Function; Mild cognitive impairment; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Attention; Cognitive functioning; JNC-8 Guidelines,

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 3886 individuals with mild cognitive impairment evaluated and followed at 34 National Alzheimer Coordinating Center sites, informant-reported Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) items associated with progression to dementia were derived in a training set (n=1943) and tested in the validation set (n=1943). RESULTS: In the training set, the optimal combination comprised 6 FAQ items (FAQ6): difficulties with finances (2 items), remembering events/appointments, playing games of skill, current events, and travel. In the validation set, hazard ratio for dementia increased from 2.00 for 1 FAQ6 deficit to 5.56 for 6 FAQ6 deficits. In patients 50 to 67 years old with high Mini Mental State Exam scores, dementia risk rose from 12.06% for no FAQ6 deficits to 56.75% for 6 functional deficits.

Recently, vascular risk factors have been recognized as important modifiers of the clinical presentation of AD. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of our study is to investigate the mechanism through which vascular risk factors mediate psychosis and whether or not it involves cerebrovascular lesions. METHODS: Data was provided by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre. The Uniform Data Set was used to collect information on subject-reported history of vascular risk factors, clinician-reported state of cognitive performance, and presence of psychosis based on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). The Neuropathology Data Set was used to evaluate the presence of vascular lesions and the severity of AD pathology. Subjects with high probability of AD based on the NIA/AA Reagan criteria were included in the analysis. RESULTS: We identified 1,459 patients with high probability of AD and corresponding NPI-Q scores. We confirmed the association between hypertension and diabetes on psychosis, specifically in delusions and the co-occurrence of delusions and hallucinations. Furthermore, the presence of white matter rarefaction based on pathological evaluation was associated with hallucinations. A history of vascular risk factors was positively associated with vascular lesions. However, vascular lesions in the presence of vascular risk factors did not increase the likelihood of psychosis. Furthermore, vascular lesions were not associated with greater cognitive or functional impairments in this group with severe AD pathology.

METHODS: Data was collected from the UDS data as of 2015 on the NACC database. Patients were stratified as intermediate (IAD) or high (HAD) pathological load of AD. Clinical diagnoses were not considered; additional pathological diagnoses were treated as variables. Analysis of data did not include a control group or corrections for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: 1,716 patients met the eligibility criteria; 31.2% of the IAD and 47.8% of the HAD patients were A(+), indicating an association with severity of pathology (p = 0.001).

RESULTS: We identified 517 DhMRs significantly associated with neuritic plaques and 60 DhMRs associated with neurofibrillary tangles. DNA hydroxymethylation in gene bodies was predominantly positively correlated with cis-acting gene expression. Moreover, genes showing differential hydroxymethylation were significantly enriched in neurobiological processes and clustered in functional gene ontology categories.

We then examined the relation of history of cancer with measures of AD pathology at autopsy, i.e., paired helical filament tau (PHFtau) neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-β load. RESULTS: Participants reporting a history of cancer had significantly lower odds of AD (OR 0.70 [0.55-0.89], p = 0.0040) proximate to death as compared to participants reporting no prior history of cancer.

A broad depression phenotype including both phenotypes has not been tested previously using a genome-wide association approach. We aimed to identify genetic polymorphisms significantly associated with a broad phenotype from depressive symptoms to major depressive disorder. METHODS: We analyzed two prior studies of 70,017 participants of European ancestry from general and clinical populations in the discovery stage. We performed a replication meta-analysis of 28,328 participants. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability and genetic correlations were calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression. Discovery and replication analyses were performed using a p-value-based meta-analysis. Lifetime major depressive disorder and depressive symptom scores were used as the outcome measures. RESULTS: The SNP-based heritability of major depressive disorder was 0.21 (SE = 0.02), the SNP-based heritability of depressive symptoms was 0.04 (SE = 0.01), and their genetic correlation was 1.001 (SE = 0.2). We found one genome-wide significant locus related to the broad depression phenotype (rs9825823, chromosome 3: 61,082,153, p = 8.2 × 10-9) located in an intron of the FHIT gene. We replicated this SNP in independent samples (p = .02) and the overall meta-analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts (1.0 × 10-9). CONCLUSIONS: This large study identified a new locus for depression. Our results support a continuum between depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder. A phenotypically more inclusive approach may help to achieve the large sample sizes needed to detect susceptibility loci for depression.",01/09/2017,322-329,Biol Psychiatry,PubMed,PMID: 28049566 PMCID: PMC5462867,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28049566,Humans; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Genome-wide association study; Depression; White People; Genetic Loci; Neoplasm Proteins; Depressive Disorder; Acid Anhydride Hydrolases; CHARGE consortium; Depressive symptoms; FHIT gene; Major depressive disorder; Psychiatric Genomics Consortium,

METHODS: We used data from 2,617 older persons without dementia. Assessment included baseline self-report UI and annual structured exam which assessed parkinsonian signs, motor performances, cognitive function, and self-report disabilities. We used a series of Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association of UI with parkinsonism and adverse health outcomes and a mixed-effect model to examine the association of UI with the annual rate of cognitive decline. In decedents, regression models were used to examine if UI proximate to death was related to postmortem indices of neuropathologies. RESULTS: At baseline, more than 45% of participants reported some degree of UI. Over an average of nearly 8 years of follow-up, UI was associated with incident parkinsonism (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.12), death (HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.11), incident ADL disability (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.16), and incident mobility disability (HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.13).

Recent evidence further suggests a racial difference in the sense of smell among U.S. older adults. However, no genome-wide association study (GWAS) on the sense of smell has been conducted in African-Americans (AAs). We performed the first genome-wide meta-analysis of the sense of smell among 1979 AAs and 6582 European-Americans (EAs) from three U.S. aging cohorts. In the AA population, we identified nine novel regions (KLF4-ACTL7B, RAPGEF2-FSTL5, TCF4-LOC100505474, PCDH10, KIAA1751, MYO5B, MIR320B1-CD2, NR5A2-LINC00862, SALL1-C16orf97) that were associated with the sense of smell (P < 5 × 10-8).

However, the gene expression changes underlying microglia activation in response to tau pathology remain elusive. Furthermore, it is not clear how murine gene expression changes relate to human gene expression networks. METHODS: Microglia cells were isolated from rTg4510 tau transgenic mice and gene expression was profiled using RNA sequencing. Four age groups of mice (2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-months) were analyzed to capture longitudinal gene expression changes that correspond to varying levels of pathology, from minimal tau accumulation to massive neuronal loss. Statistical and system biology approaches were used to analyze the genes and pathways that underlie microglia activation. Differentially expressed genes were compared to human brain co-expression networks. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of RNAseq data indicated that more than 4000 genes were differentially expressed in rTg4510 microglia compared to wild type microglia, with the majority of gene expression changes occurring between 2- and 4-months of age. These genes belong to four major clusters based on their temporal expression pattern. Genes involved in innate immunity were continuously up-regulated, whereas genes involved in the glutamatergic synapse were down-regulated. Up-regulated innate inflammatory pathways included NF-κB signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, lysosome, oxidative phosphorylation, and phagosome. NF-κB and cytokine signaling were among the earliest pathways activated, likely driven by the RELA, STAT1 and STAT6 transcription factors. The expression of many AD associated genes such as APOE and TREM2 was also altered in rTg4510 microglia cells.

METHODS: As part of the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project, WGS data were generated for 197 NHW participants from 42 families (affected individuals and unaffected, elderly relatives). A two-pronged approach was taken. First, variants were prioritized using heterogeneity logarithm of the odds (HLOD) and family-specific LOD scores as well as annotations based on function, frequency, and segregation with disease. Second, known Alzheimer disease (AD) candidate genes were assessed for rare variation using a family-based association test. RESULTS: We identified 41 rare, predicted-damaging variants that segregated with disease in the families that contributed to the HLOD or family-specific LOD regions. These included a variant in nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein that segregates with disease in a family with 7 individuals with AD, as well as variants in RP11-433J8, ABCA1, and FISP2. Rare-variant association identified 2 LOAD candidate genes associated with disease in these families: FERMT2 (p-values = 0.001) and SLC24A4 (p-value = 0.009). These genes still showed association while controlling for common index variants, indicating the rare-variant signal is distinct from common variation that initially identified the genes as candidates. CONCLUSIONS: We identified multiple genes with putative damaging rare variants that segregate with disease in multiplex AD families and showed that rare variation may influence AD risk at AD candidate genes. These results identify novel AD candidate genes and show a role for rare variation in LOAD etiology, even at genes previously identified by common variation.",2018-12,e286,Neurol Genet,PubMed,PMID: 30569016 PMCID: PMC6278241,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30569016,,

METHOD: The research design involved secondary analysis of data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center database.

Neuropsychological data were used to derive 5 PVTs. RESULTS: False positive rates on individual PVTs ranged from 3.3 to 26.3% with several embedded PVTs showing acceptable specificity across groups. The proportion of participants failing two or more PVTs varied by cognitive status: normal (1.9%), impaired (6.6%), MCI (13.2%), and dementia (52.8%). Comparison of observed and predicted false positive rates at different specificity levels (.85 or .90) demonstrated significant differences in all comparisons. In normal and impaired groups, predicted rates were higher than observed rates. In the MCI group, predicted and observed comparisons varied: Predicted rates were higher with specificity at .85 and lower with specificity at .90. In the dementia group, predicted rates underestimated observed rates. CONCLUSIONS: Despite elevated false positives in conditions involving severe cognitive compromise, several measures retain acceptable specificity regardless of cognitive status. Predicted false positive rates based on the number of PVTs administered were not observed empirically.

Predictors of increased risk are incompletely understood. Identification of potentially modifiable risk factors could facilitate prevention of MCI and dementia. This study aimed to determine which clinical characteristics are associated with increased risk of MCI among older adults with depression and normal cognition at baseline. METHODS: Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset were used. Study participants who attended a participating Alzheimer's Disease Center from September 2005 through September 2017 with normal cognition and a history of clinically defined depression (broadly based on DSM criteria) were followed until first diagnosis of MCI (or dementia when MCI was not diagnosed). RESULTS: A total of 2,655 study participants were followed for a median duration of 41.8 months. Of these, 586 (22.1%) developed either MCI (n = 509, 19.2%) or dementia (n = 77, 2.9%). In survival analyses, cognitive decline was associated with age, sex, education, baseline cognition, and several potentially modifiable risk factors including vascular risk factors, hearing impairment, vitamin B₁₂ deficiency, active depression within the last 2 years, and increased severity of depression. In an adjusted survival analysis, the only variables that remained significantly associated with development of MCI or dementia were female sex (HR = 0.72; 95% CI, 0.59-0.88), higher education (HR = 0.96; 95% CI, 0.93-0.99), and higher baseline cognition (HR = 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.93), which were associated with reduced risk, and older age (HR = 1.07; 95% CI, 1.05-1.08), active depression within the last 2 years (HR = 1.41; 95% CI, 1.15-1.74), and increased severity of depression (HR = 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09), which were associated with increased risk.

A numerically higher rate of the secondary end point of death from any cause was observed with aspirin than with placebo. METHODS: From 2010 through 2014, we enrolled community-dwelling persons in Australia and the United States who were 70 years of age or older (or ≥65 years of age among blacks and Hispanics in the United States) and did not have cardiovascular disease, dementia, or disability. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo. Deaths were classified according to the underlying cause by adjudicators who were unaware of trial-group assignments. Hazard ratios were calculated to compare mortality between the aspirin group and the placebo group, and post hoc exploratory analyses of specific causes of death were performed. RESULTS: Of the 19,114 persons who were enrolled, 9525 were assigned to receive aspirin and 9589 to receive placebo. A total of 1052 deaths occurred during a median of 4.7 years of follow-up. The risk of death from any cause was 12.7 events per 1000 person-years in the aspirin group and 11.1 events per 1000 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01 to 1.29). Cancer was the major contributor to the higher mortality in the aspirin group, accounting for 1.6 excess deaths per 1000 person-years. Cancer-related death occurred in 3.1% of the participants in the aspirin group and in 2.3% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.10 to 1.56). CONCLUSIONS: Higher all-cause mortality was observed among apparently healthy older adults who received daily aspirin than among those who received placebo and was attributed primarily to cancer-related death.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg per day of enteric-coated aspirin or placebo orally. The primary end point was a composite of death, dementia, or persistent physical disability. Secondary end points reported in this article included the individual components of the primary end point and major hemorrhage. RESULTS: A total of 19,114 persons with a median age of 74 years were enrolled, of whom 9525 were randomly assigned to receive aspirin and 9589 to receive placebo. A total of 56.4% of the participants were women, 8.7% were nonwhite, and 11.0% reported previous regular aspirin use. The trial was terminated at a median of 4.7 years of follow-up after a determination was made that there would be no benefit with continued aspirin use with regard to the primary end point.

Our team's previously published paper showed that patients who used statins demonstrated no increase in cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment when compared with nonusers. Further, AD patients on statins demonstrated a slight decreasing trend in cognitive decline. The purpose of this study is therefore to investigate the association between stain use in AD confirmed by clinical diagnosis and autopsy and the pathological burden (plaques, tangles, Braak stage). The hypothesis leading this investigation is that prolonged statin use associates with lower AD pathology at autopsy. METHODS: We queried the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database for autopsy-confirmed AD cases. Of the Uniform Data Set (UDS) participants who are deceased, 16,163 were diagnosed with dementia at their last UDS visit prior to death, and autopsy data are available for 3945 patients. These patients were then stratified into two groups based upon statin use. The two groups were then analyzed for their pathological AD burden, including total plaques, total tangles, age at death, age of onset, and Braak stage. RESULTS: NACC data were available for 1816 subjects with clinically and pathologically confirmed AD; 1558 were not on statins and 258 were on statins. No significant differences in age at death, age at onset, Braak stages, mean total tau, and mean total amyloid were found between the two subject groups. When statin use was analyzed by apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype carrier statins, the presence of ApoE4 did not influence the effects (or lack thereof) of statin use.

After intranasal administration, WT TIDM peptide reached the hippocampus, reduced hippocampal glial activation, lowered Aβ burden, attenuated neuronal apoptosis, and improved memory and learning in 5XFAD mice. However, WT TIDM peptide was not effective in 5XFAD mice lacking TLR2. In addition to its effects in 5XFAD mice, WT TIDM peptide also suppressed the disease process in mice with experimental allergic encephalomyelitis and collagen-induced arthritis. Therefore, selective targeting of the activated status of 1 component of the innate immune system by WT TIDM peptide may be beneficial in AD as well as other disorders in which TLR2/MyD88 signaling plays a role in disease pathogenesis.",01/10/2018,4297-4312,J Clin Invest,PubMed,PMID: 29990310 PMCID: PMC6159992,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29990310,"Alzheimer’s disease; Female; Humans; Male; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Peptides; Mice; Signal Transduction; Inflammation; Alzheimer Disease; Disease Models, Animal; Mice, Transgenic; Hippocampus; Autoimmune diseases; Innate immunity; Myeloid Differentiation Factor 88; Neuroscience; Toll-Like Receptor 2",

We studied the association between multiple medication use and incident dementia diagnoses including Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), and Lewy-body dementia (LBD), simultaneously accounting for dropout. METHODS: Using the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data with three years of follow-up, a set of covariate-adjusted models that ignore dropout was fit to complete-case data, and to the whole-cohort data. Additionally, covariate-adjusted joint models with shared random effects accounting for dropout were fit to the whole-cohort data. Multiple medication use was defined as polypharmacy (⩾ five medications), hyperpolypharmacy (⩾ ten medications), and total number of medications. RESULTS: Incident diagnoses were 2,032 for AD, 135 for VD, and 139 for LBD. Percentages of dropout at the end of follow-up were as follows: 71.8% for AD, 81.5% for VD, and 77.7% for LBD. The odds ratio (OR) estimate for hyperpolypharmacy among those with LBD versus AD was 2.19 (0.78, 6.15) when estimated using complete-case data and 3.00 (1.66, 5.40) using whole-cohort data. The OR reduced to 1.41 (0.76, 2.64) when estimated from the joint model accounting for dropout. The OR for polypharmacy using complete-case data differed from the estimates using whole-cohort data. The OR for dementia diagnoses on total number of medications was similar, but non-significant when estimated using complete-case data.

However, calpains are also critical for synaptic function and plasticity, and hence memory formation and learning. Since synaptic deficits appear early in AD pathogenesis prior to appearance of overt disease symptoms, we examined if localized dysregulation of calpain-1 and/or 2 contributes to early synaptic dysfunction in AD. Increased activity of synaptosomal calpain-2, but not calpain-1 was observed in presymptomatic 1 month old APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice (a mouse model of AD) which have no evident pathological or behavioural hallmarks of AD and persisted up to 10 months of age. However, total cellular levels of calpain-2 remained unaffected. Moreover, synaptosomal calpain-2 was hyperactivated in frontal neocortical tissue samples of post-mortem brains of AD-dementia subjects and correlated significantly with decline in tests for cognitive and memory functions, and increase in levels of β-amyloid deposits in brain. We conclude that isoform-specific hyperactivation of calpain-2, but not calpain-1 occurs at the synapse early in the pathogenesis of AD potentially contributing to the deregulation of synaptic signaling in AD.

Since many on-going AD prevention studies are testing therapies that target either amyloid or tau, we sought to establish an association between a cognitive composite score and the underlying pathology of AD. METHODS: Data from 192 older deceased and autopsied persons from the Rush Religious Order Study were used in this study. All participants were classified at their initial evaluations with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI). Of these individuals, 105 remained NCI at the time of their death while the remaining 87 progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. A cognitive composite score composed of eight cognitive tests was used as the outcome measure. Individuals were classified into groups based on Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropathological diagnosis and Braak stage. RESULTS: The rate of annualized composite score decline was significantly greater for the high CERAD (p < 0.001, d = 0.56) and Braak (p < 0.001, d = 0.55) groups compared with the low CERAD and Braak groups, respectively.

We aimed to measure these effects. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed data from 3,353 participants from 3 observational community-based cohort studies of older persons (the Rush Memory and Aging Project [MAP], the Religious Orders Study [ROS], and the Minority Aging Research Study [MARS]) and 2 observational memory-clinic-based cohort studies (Centre de Neurologie Cognitive [CNC] study at Lariboisière Hospital and the Sunnybrook Dementia Study [SDS]). We performed neuropsychological testing and, in subsets of participants, evaluated cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers, standardized structured autopsy measures, and/or prefrontal cortex gene expression by RNA sequencing. We examined the association between season and these variables using nested multiple linear and logistic regression models. There was a robust association between season and cognition that was replicated in multiple cohorts (amplitude = 0.14 SD [a measure of the magnitude of seasonal variation relative to overall variability; 95% CI 0.07-0.23], p = 0.007, in the combined MAP, ROS, and MARS cohorts; amplitude = 0.50 SD [95% CI 0.07-0.66], p = 0.017, in the SDS cohort). Average composite global cognitive function was higher in the summer and fall compared to winter and spring, with the difference equivalent in cognitive effect to 4.8 years' difference in age (95% CI 2.1-8.4, p = 0.002). Further, the odds of meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment or dementia were higher in the winter and spring (odds ratio 1.31 [95% CI 1.10-1.57], p = 0.003). These results were robust against multiple potential confounders including depressive symptoms, sleep, physical activity, and thyroid status and persisted in cases with AD pathology. Moreover, season had a marked effect on cerebrospinal fluid Aβ 42 level (amplitude 0.30 SD [95% CI 0.10-0.64], p = 0.003), which peaked in the summer, and on the brain expression of 4 cognition-associated modules of co-expressed genes (m6: amplitude = 0.44 SD [95% CI 0.21-0.65], p = 0.0021; m13: amplitude = 0.46 SD [95% CI 0.27-0.76], p = 0.0009; m109: amplitude = 0.43 SD [95% CI 0.24-0.67], p = 0.0021; and m122: amplitude 0.46 SD [95% CI 0.20-0.71], p = 0.0012), which were in phase or anti-phase to the rhythms of cognition and which were in turn associated with binding sites for several seasonally rhythmic transcription factors including BCL11A, CTCF, EGR1, MEF2C, and THAP1. Limitations include the evaluation of each participant or sample once per annual cycle, reliance on self-report for measurement of environmental and behavioral factors, and potentially limited generalizability to individuals in equatorial regions or in the southern hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS: Season has a clinically significant association with cognition and its neurobiological correlates in older adults with and without AD pathology. There may be value in increasing dementia-related clinical resources in the winter and early spring, when symptoms are likely to be most pronounced. Moreover, the persistence of robust seasonal plasticity in cognition and its neurobiological correlates, even in the context of concomitant AD pathology, suggests that targeting environmental or behavioral drivers of seasonal cognitive plasticity, or the key transcription factors and genes identified in this study as potentially mediating these effects, may allow us to substantially improve cognition in adults with and without AD.",2018-09,e1002647,PLoS Med,PubMed,PMID: 30180184 PMCID: PMC6122787,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30180184,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Gene Expression; Biomarkers; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Logistic Models; Prefrontal Cortex; Linear Models; Seasons",

Neurology,1474-4465,10.1016/S1474-4422(18)30251-5,"BACKGROUND: Transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy in older adults frequently coexists with Alzheimer's disease pathology and hippocampal sclerosis. It is unclear whether there is a link between APOE ε4 and TDP-43 proteinopathy, and the role of APOE ε4 in the association of TDP-43 proteinopathy with hippocampal sclerosis remains to be examined. We investigated the relationships of TDP-43 proteinopathy and hippocampal sclerosis with APOE ε4. METHODS: We used data from two community-based cohort studies of ageing and dementia: the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). A battery of cognitive tests examining multiple cognitive domains is given to ROS-MAP participants each year, and a measure of annual global cognitive function for each participant is derived by averaging Z scores of these tests. The final clinical diagnosis is assigned after death by a neurologist using all available clinical data without access to post-mortem pathology. Amyloid-β, paired helical filament tau, Lewy bodies, TDP-43, and hippocampal sclerosis were microscopically evaluated in the midbrain, medial temporal, and neocortical regions that capture the progression of each neuropathology. TDP-43 proteinopathy topographic stage was recorded as an ordinal variable, and TDP-43 burden was defined by averaging a semi-quantitative six-point scale across six brain regions. The relationships among APOE ε4, TDP-43 proteinopathy, and hippocampal sclerosis were tested with regression models controlled for sex and age at death, and they were further explored with a mediation analysis using the quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo method. FINDINGS: ROS began data collection in 1994, and MAP began data collection in 1997. The data included in this study were analysed from Jan 16, 2017, to July 12, 2017. When analysis began in January, 2017, a total of 1059 ROS-MAP participants who were deceased had APOE genotype and complete pathological measures for amyloid-β, paired helical filament tau, and TDP-43 proteinopathy stage. After excluding 15 participants with other pathological diagnoses, 1044 participants, 1042 of whom also had measures of Lewy body pathology, were included in this study (470 from ROS and 574 from MAP). APOE ε4 count was associated with higher TDP-43 proteinopathy stage (odds ratio [OR] 2·0, 95% CI 1·6-2·6; p=1·9 × 10-9) and TDP-43 burden (0·40, 0·28-0·52; p=1·2 × 10-10). Amyloid-β, paired helical filament tau, or Lewy body pathology did not fully explain this association. APOE ε4 increased the odds of hippocampal sclerosis (OR 2·1, 95% CI 1·4-3·0; p=1·7 × 10-4); this effect was largely mediated by TDP-43 burden (mediated effect p<1·0 × 10-4) but not directly by APOE ε4 (direct effect p=0·40). APOE ε4 was associated with worse global cognition proximate to death even after adjusting for amyloid-β and paired helical filament tau (estimated effect -0·18, 95% CI -0·31 to -0·04; p=0·010), but this association was attenuated by additionally adjusting for TDP-43 burden (-0·09, -0·22 to 0·04; p=0·18). INTERPRETATION: APOE ε4 seems to increase TDP-43 burden, and this effect in turn was associated with higher odds of hippocampal sclerosis, a pathology potentially downstream of TDP-43 proteinopathy. TDP-43 proteinopathy contributes to the detrimental effect of APOE ε4 on late-life cognition through mechanisms independent of Alzheimer's disease pathology, and future research should consider that TDP-43 proteinopathy might be an integral component of APOE-related neurodegeneration.

Additionally, nbM neuronal activity and cholinergic tone are regulated by the expression of nicotinic (nAChR) and muscarinic (mAChR) acetylcholine receptors as well as receptors modulating glutamatergic and catecholaminergic afferent signaling. To date, the molecular and cellular relationships between the evolution of tau pathology and nbM neuronal survival remain unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we profiled cholinotrophic pathway genes within nbM neurons immunostained for pS422, a pretangle phosphorylation event preceding tau C-terminal truncation at D421, or dual-labeled for pS422 and TauC3, a later stage tau neo-epitope revealed by this same C-terminal truncation event, via single-population custom microarray analysis. nbM neurons were obtained from postmortem tissues from subjects who died with an antemortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or mild/moderate AD. Quantitative analysis revealed significant downregulation of mRNAs encoding TrkA as well as TrkB, TrkC, and the Trk-mediated downstream pro-survival kinase Akt in pS422+ compared to unlabeled, pS422-negative nbM neurons. In addition, pS422+ neurons displayed a downregulation of transcripts encoding NMDA receptor subunit 2B, metabotropic glutamate receptor 2, D2 dopamine receptor, and β1 adrenoceptor. By contrast, transcripts encoding p75NTR were downregulated in dual-labeled pS422+/TauC3+ neurons. Appearance of the TauC3 epitope was also associated with an upregulation of the α7 nAChR subunit and differential downregulation of the β2 nAChR subunit. Notably, we found that gene expression patterns for each cell phenotype did not differ with clinical diagnosis. However, linear regression revealed that global cognition and Braak stage were predictors of select transcript changes within both unlabeled and pS422+/TauC3- neurons. Taken together, these cell phenotype-specific gene expression profiling data suggest that dysregulation of neurotrophic and neurotransmitter signaling is an early pathogenic mechanism associated with NFT formation in vulnerable nbM neurons and cognitive decline in AD, which may be amenable to therapeutic intervention early in the disease process.",2018-09,125-136,Neurobiol Dis,PubMed,PMID: 29859871 PMCID: PMC6278831,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29859871,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Disease Progression; Nerve Growth Factors; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Mild cognitive impairment; Nerve Growth Factor; Basal Nucleus of Meynert; Cholinergic basal forebrain; Cholinergic Neurons; Receptor, Nerve Growth Factor; Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor; Acetylcholine receptor; Adrenoceptor; Dopamine receptor; Glutamate receptor; Neurotransmission; Neurotrophin; Nucleus basalis of Meynert; Receptors, Neurotransmitter; Trk receptor",

METHODS: This clinical-pathologic study was derived from prospective, community-based cohort studies of aging with similar design and data collection. Measurements of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were obtained annually (mean follow-up 8 years, SD = 4.8). Postmortem neuropathologic evaluations documented diseases of aging. Using regression analyses, we examined associations of average and decline in late-life SBP, and separately in DBP, with neuropathology. RESULTS: In 1,288 persons (mean age at death = 88.6 years; 65% women), the mean standardized person-specific SBP across the study was 134 (SD = 13) and DBP was 71 (SD = 8) mm Hg. The odds of brain infarcts were increased for participants with a higher mean SBP. Specifically, a person with a 1 SD SBP above the mean (147 vs 134 mm Hg) would have a 46% increased odds of having one or more infarcts, and an increased odds of gross infarct (46%) and microinfarct (36%). Furthermore, a more rapidly declining SBP slope over time increased the odds of one or more infarcts. Mean DBP, not slope, was related to brain infarcts. AD pathology analyses showed an association of a higher mean SBP with higher number of tangles (p = 0.038) but not plaques or other pathology (all p > 0.06). Changes in BP were not significantly related to AD pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Higher average late-life SBP and DBP, and independently a faster decline in SBP, are associated with increasing number of brain infarcts, including gross and microinfarcts. We found some evidence for a relation of SBP with AD, specifically tangles.

METHODS: We included 1120 incident Alzheimer disease (AD) cases with at least one assessment after diagnosis, originating from 31 AD centres from the United States. Trajectories of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes (CDR-sb) were modelled jointly over time using parallel-process growth mixture models in order to identify latent classes of trajectories. Bias-corrected multinomial logistic regression was used to identify baseline predictors of class membership and compare these with the predictors found in the Cache County Dementia Progression Study. RESULTS: The best-fitting model contained 3 classes: Class 1 was the largest (63%) and showed the slowest progression on both MMSE and CDR-sb; classes 2 (22%) and 3 (15%) showed moderate and rapid worsening, respectively. Significant predictors of membership in classes 2 and 3, relative to class 1, were worse baseline MMSE and CDR-sb, higher education, and lack of hypertension. Combining all previously mentioned predictors yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.70 and 0.75 for classes 2 and 3, respectively, relative to class 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our replication study confirmed that it is possible to predict trajectories of progression in AD with relatively good accuracy.

There is a higher incidence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in African American populations as compared to White populations, even when controlling for sociodemographic factors. The existing body of ethnically/racially targeted research on MCI has been limited by few studies with the ability to generalize to African American communities. This study sought to examine whether medical conditions which occur at a higher rate in African American individuals increase the hazard of subsequent MCI development. A secondary data analysis of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set was employed to examine the associations between health conditions (congestive heart failure, traumatic brain injury, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, B12 deficiency, thyroid disease) and their relationship to MCI. The analytic sample included 2847 participants with 9872 observations. Binary logistic generalized estimating equation modeling was used to examine repeated measures over the course of 1-11 observations. Education was associated with MCI development, specifically those with some college or college graduates (p < 0.001) and more than college (p = 0.002). Female sex was associated with development of MCI (p < 0.001). African Americans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) were more likely to develop MCI (p < 0.001) compared to those with no reports of a TBI. Inactive thyroid conditions decreased the risk of MCI development (p = 0.005) compared to those without thyroid disease. Though vascular factors are often attributed to higher mortality and neurodegeneration in African Americans, congestive heart failure, diabetes, high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, nor seizures were associated with an increased risk of MCI development. Findings from this study provide formative data to develop targeted interventions for subsets of the African American community, including those with higher educational levels, those with TBI, and those with a history of thyroid disease. While it may not be possible to prevent MCI development, it is possible to modify lifestyle behaviors contributing to these health conditions, such as falls that are often experienced by older adults.

The maintenance of energy metabolism, through the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) apparatus, is essential for brain health. Given the known association between reproductive period (years from menarche to menopause) and cognitive aging, we examined the hypothesis that cumulative estrogen exposure across the lifetime may be associated with differential methylation of genes in the OXPHOS pathway. METHODS: Using DNA methylation patterns in the post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 426 women prospectively followed until death in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, we examined the relationship between reproductive period (subtracting age at menarche from age at menopause) and DNA methylation of a published set of autosomal OXPHOS genes previously implicated in stroke susceptibility. We then performed an unsupervised analysis of methylation levels across the Hallmark pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database. RESULTS: We observed a strong association between reproductive period and DNA methylation status across OXPHOS CpGs. We replicated this association between reproductive period and DNA methylation in a much larger set of OXPHOS genes in our unsupervised analysis. Here, reproductive period also showed associations with methylation in genes related to E2F, MYC and MTORC1 signaling, fatty acid metabolism and DNA repair.

The results highlight the power of systems approaches for identifying genes involved in disease pathways., Our hypothesis is that changes in gene and protein expression are crucial to the development of late-onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. Previously we examined how DNA alleles control downstream expression of RNA transcripts and how those relationships are changed in late-onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. We have now examined how proteins are incorporated into networks in two separate series and evaluated our outputs in two different cell lines. Our pipeline included the following steps: (i) predicting expression quantitative trait loci; (ii) determining differential expression; (iii) analysing networks of transcript and peptide relationships; and (iv) validating effects in two separate cell lines. We performed all our analysis in two separate brain series to validate effects.

However, we do not know whether risk for inflammatory disease predisposes unaffected individuals to late-life cognitive deficits or AD-related neuropathology. We investigated whether genetic risk scores for seven immune diseases and central nervous system traits were related to cognitive decline (nmax = 1601), classical AD neuropathology (nmax = 985), or microglial density (nmax = 184). METHODS: Longitudinal cognitive decline, postmortem amyloid and tau neuropathology, microglial density, and gene module expression from bulk brain tissue were all measured in participants from two large cohorts (the Rush Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project; ROS/MAP) of elderly subjects (mean age at entry 78 +/- 8.7 years). We analyzed data primarily using robust regression methods. Neuropathologists were blind to clinical data. RESULTS: The AD genetic risk scores, including and excluding APOE effects, were strongly associated with cognitive decline in all domains (min Puncor = 3.2 × 10- 29). Multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia risk did not influence cognitive decline in older age, but the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk score alone was significantly associated with microglial density after correction (t146 = - 3.88, Puncor = 1.6 × 10- 4). Post-hoc tests found significant effects of the RA genetic risk score in multiple regions and stages of microglial activation (min Puncor = 1.5 × 10- 6). However, these associations were driven by only one or two variants, rather than cumulative polygenicity. Further, individual MS (Pone-sided < 8.4 × 10- 4) and RA (Pone-sided = 3 × 10- 4) variants associated with higher microglial density were also associated with increased expression of brain immune gene modules. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that global risk of inflammatory disease does not strongly influence aging-related cognitive decline but that susceptibility variants that influence peripheral immune function also alter microglial density and immune gene expression in the aging brain, opening a new perspective on the control of microglial and immune responses within the central nervous system.

An integrated cross-platform analysis is expected to improve resolution and accuracy, yet there is no tool for effectively combining data from sequencing and array platforms.

RESULTS: We propose a statistical framework, integrated CNV (iCNV) detection algorithm, which can be applied to multiple study designs: WES only, WGS only, SNP array only, or any combination of SNP and sequencing data. iCNV applies platform-specific normalization, utilizes allele specific reads from sequencing and integrates matched NGS and SNP-array data by a hidden Markov model. We compare integrated two-platform CNV detection using iCNV to naïve intersection or union of platforms and show that iCNV increases sensitivity and robustness. We also assess the accuracy of iCNV on WGS data only and show that the utilization of allele-specific reads improve CNV detection accuracy compared to existing methods.

Neurobiological mechanisms supporting temporal discounting have been explored among younger participants, and these have considered white matter integrity. However, the white matter correlates of temporal discounting in older adults are unclear. We hypothesized that greater temporal discounting would be associated with poorer white matter integrity measures, more specifically lower fractional anisotropy and higher trace, in older adults.

Results revealed significant associations between temporal discounting and white matter integrity measures (FA and trace) in bilateral frontal, frontostriatal, and temporal-parietal lobe white matter tracts, and results remained significant after further accounting for global cognition.

We evaluated sex interactions at previous loci, performed sex-stratified GWAS to identify sex-specific associations, and evaluated sex interactions at sex-specific GWAS loci. We then evaluated sex-specific associations between prefrontal cortex (PFC) gene expression at relevant loci and autopsy measures of plaques and tangles using data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. In Aβ42, we observed sex interactions at one previous and one novel locus: rs316341 within SERPINB1 (p = 0.04) and rs13115400 near LINC00290 (p = 0.002). These loci showed stronger associations among females (β = - 0.03, p = 4.25 × 10-8; β = 0.03, p = 3.97 × 10-8) than males (β = - 0.02, p = 0.009; β = 0.01, p = 0.20). Higher levels of expression of SERPINB1, SERPINB6, and SERPINB9 in PFC was associated with higher levels of amyloidosis among females (corrected p values < 0.02) but not males (p > 0.38). In total tau, we observed a sex interaction at a previous locus, rs1393060 proximal to GMNC (p = 0.004), driven by a stronger association among females (β = 0.05, p = 4.57 × 10-10) compared to males (β = 0.02, p = 0.03). There was also a sex-specific association between rs1393060 and tangle density at autopsy (pfemale = 0.047; pmale = 0.96), and higher levels of expression of two genes within this locus were associated with lower tangle density among females (OSTN p = 0.006; CLDN16 p = 0.002) but not males (p ≥ 0.32). Results suggest a female-specific role for SERPINB1 in amyloidosis and for OSTN and CLDN16 in tau pathology.

METHODS: We used data from 1,362 autopsied participants of three community-based clinicopathological cohorts: the Religious Orders Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, and the Minority Aging Research Study. We estimated a series of structural equation models summarizing a priori hypothesized neuropathological pathways between age and dementia risk individually and collectively. RESULTS: At time of death (mean age, 89 years), 44% of our sample had a clinical dementia diagnosis. When considered individually, our vascular, amyloid/tau, neocortical Lewy body, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)/hippocampal sclerosis pathology pathways each accounted for a substantial proportion of the association between age and dementia. When considered collectively, the four pathways fully accounted for all variance in dementia risk previously attributable to age. Pathways involving amyloid/tau, neocortical Lewy bodies, and TDP-43/hippocampal sclerosis were interdependent, attributable to the importance of amyloid beta plaques in all three. The importance of the pathways varied, with the vascular pathway accounting for 32% of the association between age and dementia, wheraes the remaining three inter-related degenerative pathways together accounted for 68% (amyloid/tau, 24%; the Lewy body, 1%; and TDP-43/hippocampal sclerosis, 43%). INTERPRETATION: Age-related increases in dementia risk can be attributed to accumulation of multiple pathologies, each of which contributes to dementia risk.

To explore noncognitive manifestations in these cASYM individuals, we aim to investigate the prevalence and pathologic substrates of psychosis. METHODS: Data were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. The Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire, quick version was used to evaluate presence of psychosis. Subjects with Mini-Mental Status Examination score of ≥24 with frequent neuritic plaques (NPs) were defined as NPcASYM, and those with Braak and Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangles of V/VI were defined as NTcASYM (both groups collectively designated cASYM). Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between NP and neurofibrillary tangle severity and psychosis accounting for potential confounders. RESULTS: We identified 667 subjects with Mini-Mental Status Examination score of ≥24, of which 137 were NPcASYM and 96 were NTcASYM. NPcASYM were at significantly higher risk of having psychosis compared with those with moderate or sparse/no NP (odds ratio, 2.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.54-3.96). NTcASYM were also at higher risk compared with those with Braak and Braak stage I to IV, but the association explained by the effect of Lewy body pathology and microinfarcts.

METHODS: Cross-sectional associations were examined between serum immune markers of activation (neopterin) and inflammation (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and C-reactive protein) with regional brain volumes (cortical, subcortical, total gray matter, hippocampus, and subfields) and cognition in 66 HIV-infected, virally suppressed, adults who underwent 3.0-T MRI as part of the Research Core of the Rush Center of Excellence on Disparities in HIV and Aging. Immune markers were assayed from frozen plasma, values were entered into linear regression models as predictors of regional brain volumes, and interactive effects of immune response and regional brain volumes on cognition were examined. RESULTS: No inflammatory marker was associated with any regional brain volume. Higher neopterin level was associated with lower total hippocampal, presubiculum, and cornu ammonis (CA) subfield volumes. Higher neopterin level and lower total hippocampal volume were independently associated with lower episodic memory, and neopterin level fully mediated the effect of hippocampal atrophy on episodic memory. Higher neopterin levels were associated with lower presubiculum, CA1, and CA4/dentate volumes and lower semantic memory, working memory, and global cognition. CONCLUSION: Immune activation in response to HIV infection, measured by neopterin, has a deleterious and targeted effect on regional brain structure, which can be visualized with clinically available MRI measures of hippocampus and its subfields, and this effect is associated with lower cognitive function.",2018-07,e467,Neurol Neuroimmunol Neuroinflamm,PubMed,PMID: 29904644 PMCID: PMC5999345,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29904644,,

The current work targeted influential genes in this network with quantitative proteomics to identify potential novel therapeutic targets. METHODS: Data came from 834 community-based older persons who were followed annually, died, and underwent brain autopsy. Uniform structured postmortem evaluations assessed the burden of β-amyloid and other common age-related neuropathologies. Selected reaction monitoring quantified cortical protein abundance of 12 genes prioritized from a molecular network of aging human brain that is implicated in Alzheimer's dementia. Regression and linear mixed models examined the protein associations with β-amyloid load and other neuropathological indices as well as cognitive decline over multiple years preceding death. RESULTS: Average age at death was 88.6 years. Overall, 349 participants (41.9%) had Alzheimer's dementia at death. A higher level of PLXNB1 abundance was associated with more β-amyloid load (p = 1.0 × 10-7 ) and higher PHFtau tangle density (p = 2.3 × 10-7 ), and the association of PLXNB1 with cognitive decline is mediated by these known Alzheimer's disease pathologies. On the other hand, higher IGFBP5, HSPB2, and AK4 and lower ITPK1 levels were associated with faster cognitive decline, and, unlike PLXNB1, these associations were not fully explained by common neuropathological indices, suggesting novel mechanisms leading to cognitive decline. INTERPRETATION: Using targeted proteomics, this work identified cortical proteins involved in Alzheimer's dementia and begins to dissect two different molecular pathways: one affecting β-amyloid deposition and another affecting resilience without a known pathological footprint.

Although the literature has revealed many approaches in disease progression modeling, they fail to leverage these time-relevant part of patients' medical records in predicting disease's future status. This paper investigates how to predict the AD progression for a patient's next medical visit through leveraging heterogeneous medical data. Data provided by the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center includes 5432 patients with probable AD from August 31, 2005 to May 25, 2017. Long short-term memory recurrent neural networks (RNN) are adopted. The approach relies on an enhanced ""many-to-one"" RNN architecture to support the shift of time steps. Hence, the approach can deal with patients' various numbers of visits and uneven time intervals. The results show that the proposed approach can be utilized to predict patients' AD progressions on their next visits with over 99% accuracy, significantly outperforming classic baseline methods. This study confirms that RNN can effectively solve the AD progression prediction problem by fully leveraging the inherent temporal and medical patterns derived from patients' historical visits.

Most analyses, however, consider only the marginal eQTL signal, rather than dissect this signal into multiple conditionally independent signals for each gene. Here we show that analyzing conditional eQTL signatures, which could be important under specific cellular or temporal contexts, leads to improved fine mapping of GWAS associations. Using genotypes and gene expression levels from post-mortem human brain samples (n = 467) reported by the CommonMind Consortium (CMC), we find that conditional eQTL are widespread; 63% of genes with primary eQTL also have conditional eQTL. In addition, genomic features associated with conditional eQTL are consistent with context-specific (e.g., tissue-, cell type-, or developmental time point-specific) regulation of gene expression.

Diagnosis of dementia in the 1160 autopsied participants from 3 studies of community-dwelling elders was based on clinical evaluation and cognitive performance tests which were used to create summary measures of the five cognitive domains. Neuronal and glial TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions were quantitated in 8 brain regions by immunohistochemistry, and used in ANOVA and regression analyses. TDP-43 pathology was present in 547 (49.4%) participants in whom ATPC (41.9%) was the most frequently involved neocortical region and in 15.5% of these cases, ATPC was the only neocortical area with TDP-43 pathology suggesting not only that ATPC is involved early by TDP-43 but that ATPC may represent an intermediate stage between mesial temporal lobe involvement by TDP-43 and the last stage with involvement of other neocortical areas. To better study this intermediary neocortical stage, and to integrate with other staging schemes, our previous 3 stage distribution of TDP-43 pathology was revised to a 5 stage distribution scheme with stage 1 showing involvement of the amygdala only; stage 2 showed extension to hippocampus and/or entorhinal cortex; stage 3 showed extension to the ATPC; stage 4 - showed extension to the midtemporal cortex and/or OFC and finally in stage 5, there was extension to the midfrontal cortex. Clinically, cases in stages 2 to 5 had impaired episodic memory, however, stage 3 was distinct from stage 2 since stage 3 cases had significantly increased odds of dementia. The proportion of cases with hippocampal sclerosis increased progressively across the stages with stage 5 showing the largest proportion of hippocampal sclerosis cases. Stage 5 cases differed from other stages by having impairment of semantic memory and perceptual speed, in addition to episodic memory impairment.

Although established psychoeducation programs are known to benefit caregivers, attending in-person programs is challenging for them. To address this challenge, the Savvy Caregiver Program, an evidence-based psychoeducation program with demonstrated effectiveness for caregiving and disease-related outcomes, was transformed into an on-line program, Tele-Savvy. This article describes the rationale for and design of a prospective longitudinal randomized controlled trial (targeted N = 215), currently underway. The trial aims to establish Tele-Savvy's efficacy in (i) reducing the negative effects of caregiving on caregivers; (ii) promoting care recipients' quality of life; (iii) improving caregiver mastery; and to explore (iv) Tele-Savvy's efficacy among caregivers of different races/ethnicities. The mediating role of mastery will be assessed. Participants are randomized to the active condition (immediate Tele-Savvy participation), attention control, or usual care. Participants in the two latter conditions will complete Tele-Savvy 6 months post-baseline. Multilevel mixed effects models will be used to examine changes in outcomes and to model group by time (months since baseline) interactions.

Yet limited work has evaluated the association between APOE alleles and markers of AD neuropathology in a sex-specific manner. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sex differences in the association between APOE and markers of AD neuropathology measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during life or in brain tissue at autopsy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicohort study selected data from 10 longitudinal cohort studies of normal aging and AD. Cohorts had variable recruitment criteria and follow-up intervals and included population-based and clinic-based samples. Inclusion in our analysis required APOE genotype data and either CSF data available for analysis. Analyses began on November 6, 2017, and were completed on December 20, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Biomarker analyses included levels of β-amyloid 42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau measured in CSF. Autopsy analyses included Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease staging for neuritic plaques and Braak staging for neurofibrillary tangles. RESULTS: Of the 1798 patients in the CSF biomarker cohort, 862 were women, 226 had AD, 1690 were white, and the mean (SD) age was 70 [9] years. Of the 5109 patients in the autopsy cohort, 2813 were women, 4953 were white, and the mean (SD) age was 84 (9) years. After correcting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni procedure, we observed a statistically significant interaction between APOE-ε4 and sex on CSF total tau (β = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27-0.55; P < .001) and phosphorylated tau (β = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09-0.38; P = .001), whereby APOE showed a stronger association among women compared with men. Post hoc analyses suggested this sex difference was present in amyloid-positive individuals (β = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20-0.62; P < .001) but not among amyloid-negative individuals (β = 0.06; 95% CI, -0.18 to 0.31; P = .62). We did not observe sex differences in the association between APOE and β-amyloid 42, neuritic plaque burden, or neurofibrillary tangle burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We provide robust evidence of a stronger association between APOE-ε4 and CSF tau levels among women compared with men across multiple independent data sets. Interestingly, APOE-ε4 is not differentially associated with autopsy measures of neurofibrillary tangles. Together, the sex difference in the association between APOE and CSF measures of tau and the lack of a sex difference in the association with neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy suggest that APOE may modulate risk for neurodegeneration in a sex-specific manner, particularly in the presence of amyloidosis.",01/08/2018,989-998,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 29801024 PMCID: PMC6142927,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29801024,"Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Genotype; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Peptide Fragments; Sex Factors; Alzheimer Disease; Plaque, Amyloid; Neurofibrillary Tangles; tau Proteins; Apolipoproteins E; Phosphoproteins",

Scientific progress in the interim led to an initiative by the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association to update and unify the 2011 guidelines. This unifying update is labeled a ""research framework"" because its intended use is for observational and interventional research, not routine clinical care. In the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association Research Framework, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is defined by its underlying pathologic processes that can be documented by postmortem examination or in vivo by biomarkers. The diagnosis is not based on the clinical consequences of the disease (i.e., symptoms/signs) in this research framework, which shifts the definition of AD in living people from a syndromal to a biological construct. The research framework focuses on the diagnosis of AD with biomarkers in living persons. Biomarkers are grouped into those of β amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and neurodegeneration [AT(N)]. This ATN classification system groups different biomarkers (imaging and biofluids) by the pathologic process each measures. The AT(N) system is flexible in that new biomarkers can be added to the three existing AT(N) groups, and new biomarker groups beyond AT(N) can be added when they become available. We focus on AD as a continuum, and cognitive staging may be accomplished using continuous measures. However, we also outline two different categorical cognitive schemes for staging the severity of cognitive impairment: a scheme using three traditional syndromal categories and a six-stage numeric scheme. It is important to stress that this framework seeks to create a common language with which investigators can generate and test hypotheses about the interactions among different pathologic processes (denoted by biomarkers) and cognitive symptoms. We appreciate the concern that this biomarker-based research framework has the potential to be misused. Therefore, we emphasize, first, it is premature and inappropriate to use this research framework in general medical practice. Second, this research framework should not be used to restrict alternative approaches to hypothesis testing that do not use biomarkers. There will be situations where biomarkers are not available or requiring them would be counterproductive to the specific research goals (discussed in more detail later in the document). Thus, biomarker-based research should not be considered a template for all research into age-related cognitive impairment and dementia; rather, it should be applied when it is fit for the purpose of the specific research goals of a study. Importantly, this framework should be examined in diverse populations. Although it is possible that β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tau deposits are not causal in AD pathogenesis, it is these abnormal protein deposits that define AD as a unique neurodegenerative disease among different disorders that can lead to dementia. We envision that defining AD as a biological construct will enable a more accurate characterization and understanding of the sequence of events that lead to cognitive impairment that is associated with AD, as well as the multifactorial etiology of dementia. This approach also will enable a more precise approach to interventional trials where specific pathways can be targeted in the disease process and in the appropriate people.",2018-04,535-562,Alzheimers Dement,PubMed,PMID: 29653606 PMCID: PMC5958625,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29653606,Humans; Animals; United States; Biomarkers; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; National Institute on Aging (U.S.); Preclinical Alzheimer's disease; Alzheimer's disease diagnosis; Alzheimer's disease imaging; Amyloid PET; Biomarkers Alzheimer's disease; CSF biomarkers Alzheimer's disease; Tau PET,

RESULTS: Myelin lesions increased with cognitive impairment in an amyloid-independent fashion with signs of degeneration appearing before neuronal loss. Myelinating OLs in the gray matter showed greater vulnerability than those in white matter, and the degenerative changes correlated with evidence of DNA damage.

Using an innovative two-step process, we develop a new epigenetic biomarker of aging, DNAm PhenoAge, that strongly outperforms previous measures in regards to predictions for a variety of aging outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cancers, healthspan, physical functioning, and Alzheimer's disease. While this biomarker was developed using data from whole blood, it correlates strongly with age in every tissue and cell tested. Based on an in-depth transcriptional analysis in sorted cells, we find that increased epigenetic, relative to chronological age, is associated with increased activation of pro-inflammatory and interferon pathways, and decreased activation of transcriptional/translational machinery, DNA damage response, and mitochondrial signatures.

The advent of low-cost, whole-genome sequencing facilitates high-resolution variant identification, and the development of linear mixed models (LMM) allows improved identification of putatively causal variants. While essential for correcting false positive associations due to sample relatedness and population stratification, LMMs have commonly been restricted to quantitative variables. However, phenotypic traits in association studies are often categorical, coded as binary case-control or ordered variables describing disease stages. To address these issues, we have devised a method for genomic association studies that implements a generalized LMM (GLMM) in a Bayesian framework, called Bayes-GLMM Bayes-GLMM has four major features: (1) support of categorical, binary, and quantitative variables; (2) cohesive integration of previous GWAS results for related traits; (3) correction for sample relatedness by mixed modeling; and (4) model estimation by both Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and maximal likelihood estimation. We applied Bayes-GLMM to the whole-genome sequencing cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. This study contains 570 individuals from 111 families, each with Alzheimer's disease diagnosed at one of four confidence levels.

The biological mechanisms, however, remain elusive. Using pericyte-deficient mice, magnetic resonance imaging, viral-based tract-tracing, and behavior and tissue analysis, we found that pericyte degeneration disrupted white-matter microcirculation, resulting in an accumulation of toxic blood-derived fibrin(ogen) deposits and blood-flow reductions, which triggered a loss of myelin, axons and oligodendrocytes. This disrupted brain circuits, leading to white-matter functional deficits before neuronal loss occurs. Fibrinogen and fibrin fibrils initiated autophagy-dependent cell death in oligodendrocyte and pericyte cultures, whereas pharmacological and genetic manipulations of systemic fibrinogen levels in pericyte-deficient, but not control mice, influenced the degree of white-matter fibrin(ogen) deposition, pericyte degeneration, vascular pathology and white-matter changes.

It remains unclear, however, how to accurately and specifically diagnose prodromal PD. We examined whether older adults with minimal parkinsonian motor features have nigrostriatal degeneration and α-synuclein pathology consistent with prodromal PD. METHODS: Brain sections were obtained from older adults with a clinical diagnosis of PD (n = 21) and without a clinical diagnosis of PD (n = 27) who underwent motor examination proximate to death. Cases without PD were further dichotomized into no motor deficit (n = 9) or minimal motor features (n = 18) groups using a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. We performed quantitative unbiased stereological analyses of dopaminergic neurons/terminals and α-synuclein accumulation in the nigrostriatal system. RESULTS: In all subjects with minimal motor features, there were significant reductions in dopaminergic neurons and terminals in the substantia nigra and putamen that were intermediate between subjects with no motor deficit and PD. Phosphorylated α-synuclein inclusions were observed in the substantia nigra that were of similar density to what was seen in PD. Furthermore, there was greater Lewy neuritic pathology in the putamen relative to PD patients. Lastly, neurons with α-synuclein inclusions displayed reductions in tyrosine hydroxylase expression that were comparable in subjects with both minimal motor features and PD. INTERPRETATION: Minimal motor features in older adults may represent prodromal PD and identify at-risk individuals for testing putative neuroprotective interventions that could slow or prevent PD progression.

Objective: To understand the magnitude of amyloid-related functional decline and to identify the functional domains sensitive to decline in a preclinical AD population. Methods: Data were from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Cognitive decline was measured by a modified version of the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite. The trajectories of functional decline, as measured by the instrumental and basic activities of daily living, were longitudinally modeled in 484 participants without cognitive impairment at baseline and having both a final clinical and a postmortem neuropathology assessment of AD. Results: Individuals with different final clinical diagnoses had different trajectories of cognitive and functional decline. Individuals with AD dementia, minor cognitive impairment, and no cognitive impairment had the most, intermediate, and least declines. While individuals with pathologic AD had significantly more cognitive decline over time than those without, the magnitude of difference in functional decline between these 2 groups was small. Functional domains such as handling finance and handling medications were more sensitive to decline.

The aim of the current study is to investigate the relationship between circulating levels of bone-related biomarkers and cognition. METHODS: The population included 103 community-dwelling older individuals with memory concerns but without cognitive impairment. A global cognition summary measure was collected at baseline and 6, 12, and 18 months post-enrollment by converting raw scores from 19 cognitive function tests to z-scores and averaging. Baseline plasma concentrations of bone-related biomarkers, including undercarboxylated, carboxylated, and total osteocalcin, parathyroid hormone, C-terminal telopeptide of collagen 1 (CTX-1), procollagen type 1 amino-terminal propeptide, osteoprotegrin, osteopontin, Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 1 (Dkk1), sclerostin, and amyloid β peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42), were measured.

Mitochondria have the capacity to handle synaptic activity up to a limit before energetic depletion occurs. Protective mechanisms driven by the induction of neuronal genes likely evolved to buffer the consequences of chronic stress on excitatory neurons in prefrontal cortex (PFC), as this circuitry is vulnerable to excitotoxic insults. Little is known about the genes involved in mitochondrial adaptation to the buildup of chronic stress. Using combinations of genetic manipulations and stress for analyzing structural, transcriptional, mitochondrial, and behavioral outcomes, we characterized NR4A1 as a stress-inducible modifier of mitochondrial energetic competence and dendritic spine number in PFC. NR4A1 acted as a transcription factor for changing the expression of target genes previously involved in mitochondrial uncoupling, AMP-activated protein kinase activation, and synaptic growth. Maintenance of NR4A1 activity by chronic stress played a critical role in the regressive synaptic organization in PFC of mouse models of stress (male only). Knockdown, dominant-negative approach, and knockout of Nr4a1 in mice and rats (male only) protected pyramidal neurons against the adverse effects of chronic stress. In human PFC tissues of men and women, high levels of the transcriptionally active NR4A1 correlated with measures of synaptic loss and cognitive impairment. In the context of chronic stress, prolonged expression and activity of NR4A1 may lead to responses of mitochondria and synaptic connectivity that do not match environmental demand, resulting in circuit malfunction between PFC and other brain regions, constituting a pathological feature across disorders.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The bioenergetic cost of chronic stress is too high to be sustainable by pyramidal prefrontal neurons. Cellular checkpoints have evolved to adjust the responses of mitochondria and synapses to the buildup of chronic stress. NR4A1 plays such a role by controlling the energetic competence of mitochondria with respect to synapse number. As an immediate-early gene, Nr4a1 promotes neuronal plasticity, but sustained expression or activity can be detrimental. NR4A1 expression and activity is sustained by chronic stress in animal models and in human studies of neuropathologies sensitive to the buildup of chronic stress. Therefore, antagonism of NR4A1 is a promising avenue for preventing the regressive synaptic reorganization in cortical systems in the context of chronic stress.",07/02/2018,1335-1350,J Neurosci,PubMed,PMID: 29295823 PMCID: PMC5815341,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29295823,"Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Animals; Chronic Disease; Mitochondria; Rats; Mice; Gene Expression Regulation; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Alzheimer Disease; Mice, Transgenic; Cognition Disorders; Prefrontal Cortex; Synapses; Dendritic Spines; Pyramidal Cells; Neuronal Plasticity; Stress, Psychological; Cell Count; dendritic spines; Hindlimb Suspension; mitochondria; Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4, Group A, Member 1; prefrontal cortex; pyramidal neurons; stress",

METHODS: A candidate-gene approach tested the association between 5 genes (28 single nucleotide polymorphisms) and Aβ load measured in vivo by the global [18F]florbetapir PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in 338 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants. Significant results were then tested using plasma Aβ and CSF Aβ and Aβ/phosphorylated tau (Aβ/p-tau) ratio in the same cohort. The significant association was also generalized to postmortem Aβ load measurement in the Rush Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project cohorts. In addition, global cognition was used as a phenotype in the analysis in both cohorts. RESULTS: Analysis of Aβ PET identified a variant in the CYP2C19 gene (rs4388808; p = 0.0006), in which carriers of the minor allele (MA) had a lower global SUVR. A voxel-wise analysis revealed that the variant is associated with a lower Aβ load in the frontal, inferior temporal, and posterior cingulate cortices. MA carriers also had higher CSF Aβ (p = 0.003) and Aβ/p-tau ratio (p = 0.02) but had no association with Aβ plasma levels. In postmortem brains, MA carriers had a lower Aβ load (p = 0.03). Global cognition was higher in MA carriers, which was found to be mediated by Aβ. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings point to an association between CYP2C19 polymorphism and Aβ pathology, suggesting a protective effect of the MA of rs4388808.

However, MCI is heterogeneous; many individuals subsequently revert to NC while others remain stable at MCI for several years. Identifying factors associated with this diagnostic instability could assist in defining clinical populations and determining cognitive prognoses. OBJECTIVE: The current study examined whether neuropsychiatric symptoms could partially account for the temporal instability in cognitive diagnoses. METHOD: The sample included 6,763 participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set. All participants had NC at baseline, completed at least two follow-up visits (mean duration: 5.5 years), and had no recent neurological conditions. Generalized linear models estimated by generalized estimating equations examined associations between changes in cognitive diagnoses and symptoms on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) and Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15). RESULTS: 1,121 participants converted from NC to MCI; 324 reverted back to NC and 242 progressed to AD dementia. Higher symptoms on the GDS-15 and circumscribed symptom domains on the NPI-Q were associated with conversion from NC to MCI and a decreased likelihood of reversion from MCI to NC. Individuals with higher symptoms on NPI-Q Hyperactivity and Mood items were more likely to progress to AD dementia.

METHODS: The sample included 82 participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Data Sets who had quantitated volume of WMH from antemortem FLAIR MRI and available neuropathological data. The Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale (from MRI visit) operationalized dementia status. ADNP+ was defined by moderate to frequent neuritic plaques and Braak stage III-VI at autopsy. Cerebrovascular disease neuropathology included infarcts or lacunes, microinfarcts, arteriolosclerosis, atherosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. RESULTS: 60/82 participants were ADNP+. Greater volume of WMH predicted increased odds for ADNP (p = 0.037). In ADNP+ participants, greater WMH corresponded with increased odds for dementia (CDR≥1; p = 0.038).

These studies, however, need to be conducted taking into consideration brain region specificity and stage of neurodegeneration in order to provide insights about the pathological role of the identified proteins. METHODS: We used a tauopathy mouse model (JNPL3) that expresses human tau bearing a P301L mutation and develops motor impairment, the severity of which correlates with the increased accumulation of pathological tau. Tissue was dissected from asymptomatic and severely motor impaired JNPL3 mice as well as non-transgenic littermate controls and subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Differentially abundant protein spots were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. Postmortem mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD and normal aging controls were used to validate the pathological significance of the identified protein. RESULTS: Ezrin was identified as a protein that is upregulated in tau-mediated neurodegeneration. We demonstrate that Ezrin protein abundance increased in JNPL3 mice preceded motor impairment and was sustained in severely motor impaired mice. Ezrin expression was also increased in the temporal cortex of MCI and AD patients.

Despite their significant progresses in genetic research, understanding the etiology and mechanism of complex phenotypes remains elusive. Using association analysis as a major analytical platform for the complex data analysis is a key issue that hampers the theoretic development of genomic science and its application in practice. Causal inference is an essential component for the discovery of mechanical relationships among complex phenotypes. Many researchers suggest making the transition from association to causation. Despite its fundamental role in science, engineering, and biomedicine, the traditional methods for causal inference require at least three variables. However, quantitative genetic analysis such as QTL, eQTL, mQTL, and genomic-imaging data analysis requires exploring the causal relationships between two variables. This paper will focus on bivariate causal discovery with continuous variables. We will introduce independence of cause and mechanism (ICM) as a basic principle for causal inference, algorithmic information theory and additive noise model (ANM) as major tools for bivariate causal discovery. Large-scale simulations will be performed to evaluate the feasibility of the ANM for bivariate causal discovery. To further evaluate their performance for causal inference, the ANM will be applied to the construction of gene regulatory networks. Also, the ANM will be applied to trait-imaging data analysis to illustrate three scenarios: presence of both causation and association, presence of association while absence of causation, and presence of causation, while lack of association between two variables. Telling cause from effect between two continuous variables from observational data is one of the fundamental and challenging problems in omics and imaging data analysis.

Therefore, with the ultimate goal of understanding molecular systems associated with cognitive decline, we infer directed interactions among regulatory elements in the local regulatory vicinity of individual genes based on brain multi-omics data from 413 individuals. These local regulatory networks (LRNs) capture the influences of genetics and epigenetics on gene expression in older adults. LRNs were confirmed through correspondence to known transcription biophysics. To relate LRNs to age-related neurologic diseases, we then incorporate common neuropathologies and measures of cognitive decline into this framework.

The APOE ε4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for the development of AD, but its association with psychosis remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the associations between psychosis, subdivided into delusions and hallucinations, as well as APOE ε4 allele on cognitive and functional outcomes. Secondarily, we investigated the associations between APOE ε4, Lewy bodies, and psychosis. METHODS: Data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) were used. Nine hundred patients with a confirmed diagnosis of AD based on the NIA-AA Reagan were included in the analysis. Global cognition was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) and functional status was assessed using the Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). Psychosis status was determined using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q). Factorial design was used to assess the effects of psychosis and APOE ε4, as well as their interaction. RESULTS: Psychosis and the presence of APOE ε4 were both associated with lower MMSE scores, while only psychosis was associated with higher FAQ scores. Furthermore, patients with hallucinations had lower MMSE and higher FAQ scores than patients with only delusions. There was a significant interaction effect between psychosis and APOE ε4 on MMSE scores, with APOE ε4 negatively affecting patients with hallucinations-only psychosis. APOE ε4 was positively associated with the presence of Lewy body pathology, and both were found to be more prevalent in psychotic patients, with a stronger association with hallucinations. CONCLUSION: Psychosis in AD was associated with greater cognitive and functional impairments. Patients with hallucinations-with or without delusions-conferred even greater deficits compared to patients with only delusions. The APOE ε4 allele was associated with worse cognition, especially for patients with hallucination-only psychosis. APOE ε4 may mediate cognitive impairment in the hallucinations phenotype through the development of Lewy bodies.

However, accurately identifying those who are destined to develop MCI is difficult. Collecting biomarkers is often expensive. METHODS: We used only noninvasive clinical variables collected in the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Sets version 2.0 and applied machine learning techniques to build a low-cost and accurate Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) conversion prediction calculator. Cross-validation and bootstrap were used to select as few variables as possible accurately predicting MCI conversion within 4 years. RESULTS: A total of 31,872 unique subjects, 748 clinical variables, and additional 128 derived variables in NACC data sets were used. About 15 noninvasive clinical variables are identified for predicting MCI/aMCI/naMCI converters, respectively. Over 75% Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curves (ROC AUC) was achieved. By bootstrap we created a simple spreadsheet calculator which estimates the probability of developing MCI within 4 years with a 95% confidence interval.

MCI, as a possible prodromal stage of AD, has gained intense interest recently, since it may be used to assess risk factors for AD. Little work has been done to combine information from both white matter and gray matter, and it is unknown how much classification power the diffusion-weighted MRI-derived structural connectome could provide beyond information available from T1-weighted MRI. In this paper, we focused on investigating whether diffusion-weighted MRI-derived structural connectome can improve differentiating healthy controls subjects from those with MCI. Specifically, we proposed a novel feature-ranking method to build classification models using the most highly ranked feature variables to classify MCI with healthy controls. We verified our method on two independent cohorts including the second stage of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI2) database and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) database. Our results indicated that 1) diffusion-weighted MRI-derived structural connectome can complement T1-weighted MRI in the classification task; 2) the feature-rank method is effective because of the identified consistent T1-weighted MRI and network feature variables on ADNI2 and NACC. Furthermore, by comparing the top-ranked feature variables from ADNI2, NACC, and combined dataset, we concluded that cross-validation using independent cohorts is necessary and highly recommended.",10/07/2005,149-169,J Alzheimers Dis,PubMed,PMID: 29865049 PMCID: PMC6272125,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29865049,"Alzheimer’s disease; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; mild cognitive impairment; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; brain network; Connectome; diffusion MRI; feature extraction; multiple cohorts",

In the NACC cohort, rpAD was delineated by the lower 10th percentile of follow up duration from pre-dementia to death duration among subjects meeting pathological diagnosis of AD. RESULTS: rpAD from the NPDPSC had a shorter mean symptom duration than the NACC identified rpAD cases (11.6 months versus 62.4 months) and were also younger at the time of their death (60.0 versus 81.8 years).

This study aims to characterize and describe the dyslexic pattern in this group of patients by comparing an English-speaking svPPA group with a Chinese-speaking svPPA group.

By accessing the database of Singapore's National Neuroscience Institute and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center of the United States, the authors identified three Chinese-speaking and 18 English-speaking patients with svPPA, respectively, for comparison. The results suggest that, instead of surface dyslexia, svPPA in Chinese-speaking individuals is characterized by a profound deep dyslexic error.

Susceptibility genes, such as apolipoprotein ε4, have long been associated with an increased risk of AD diagnosis. Studies have shown associations between depression and increased risk of AD development. Furthermore, findings from previous investigations suggest mixed effects in the use of psychotropic medication in older adults. The hypothesis for this study is that antidepressant use modifies the increased hazard of depression or such that a non-significant hazard will result with respect to eventual AD development. METHODS: Utilizing data from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, we examined evaluations of 11,443 cognitively intact participants. Survival analysis was used to explore relationships between depression, apolipoprotein E, AD diagnosis, and antidepressant use. RESULTS: An analytical sample of 8732 participants with normal cognition was examined. Among users of antidepressant medication, the hazard, in most cases, was no longer statistically significant. One generic medication showed protective benefits for users (p < 0.001). In addition, there was a statistically significant relationship between recent depression (n = 2083; p < 0.001), lifetime depression (n = 2068; p < 0.05), and ε4 carrier status (n = 2470; p < 0.001) and AD development. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a mechanism related to antidepressant use may reduce the hazard of eventual AD. Furthermore, the findings reinforce the association between depression, apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4, and AD diagnosis. This study contributes to the emerging literature exploring interventions aimed at decreasing the risk of AD by targeting potentially modifiable psychosocial risk factors such as depression.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess the association between a history of TBI and the age of onset of DLB. METHOD: Data from 576 subjects with a clinical diagnosis of DLB were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). Analyses of Covariance examined whether self-reported history of remote TBI with LOC (i.e., >1 year prior to the first Alzheimer's Disease Center visit) was associated with earlier DLB symptom onset. RESULTS: Controlling for sex, those with a history of remote TBI had an approximately 1.5-year earlier clinician-estimated age of onset (F = 0.87, p = 0.35) and 0.75-years earlier age of diagnosis (F = 0.14, p = 0.71) of DLB compared to those without a history of TBI, though the differences did not reach statistical significance. Analysis of subjects with autopsy-confirmed diagnoses was underpowered due to the low number of TBI+ subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Remote TBI with LOC was not significantly associated with DLB onset, despite being a significant risk factor for cognitive decline and earlier age of onset in other neurodegenerative conditions. Replication of these results using a larger cohort of DLB subjects with and without a TBI history who have undergone autopsy is indicated, as our TBI+ subjects did show a slightly earlier onset of about 1.5 years.

In this study, an analysis was performed on two longitudinal cohort datasets provided by 1) the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 2) the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre (NACC). The focus is on the observed improvement of individuals' clinical condition recorded in these datasets to explore potential associations with different factors. It is shown that, in both datasets, transitions from MCI to CN are significantly associated with younger age, better cognitive function, and the absence of ApoE ɛ4 alleles. Better cognitive function and in some cases the absence of ApoE ɛ4 alleles are also significantly associated with transitions from types of dementia to less severe clinical states. The effect of gender and education is not clear-cut in these datasets, although highly educated people who reach MCI tend to be more likely to show an improvement in their clinical state. The potential effect of other factors such as changes in symptoms of depression is also discussed.

We aimed to study, on a genome-wide level, if genetic correlation and pleiotropic loci exist between depressive symptoms and T2D or glycemic traits. METHODS: We estimated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability and analyzed genetic correlation between depressive symptoms and T2D and glycemic traits with the linkage disequilibrium score regression by combining summary statistics of previously conducted meta-analyses for depressive symptoms by CHARGE consortium (N = 51,258), T2D by DIAGRAM consortium (N = 34,840 patients and 114,981 controls), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function and insulin resistance by MAGIC consortium (N = 58,074). Finally, we investigated pleiotropic loci using a bivariate genome-wide association study approach with summary statistics from genome-wide association study meta-analyses and reported loci with genome-wide significant bivariate association p value (p < 5 × 10). Biological annotation and function of significant pleiotropic SNPs were assessed in several databases. RESULTS: The SNP-based heritability ranged from 0.04 to 0.10 in each individual trait. In the linkage disequilibrium score regression analyses, depressive symptoms showed no significant genetic correlation with T2D or glycemic traits (p > 0.37). However, we identified pleiotropic genetic variations for depressive symptoms and T2D (in the IGF2BP2, CDKAL1, CDKN2B-AS, and PLEKHA1 genes), and fasting glucose (in the MADD, CDKN2B-AS, PEX16, and MTNR1B genes). CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant overall genetic correlations between depressive symptoms, T2D, or glycemic traits suggesting major differences in underlying biology of these traits.

Dendritic spine structure is defined by filamentous actin (F-actin) and we observed depolymerization of synaptosomal F-actin accompanied by increased globular-actin (G-actin) at as early as 1 month of age in a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1ΔE9, male mice). This led to recall deficit after contextual fear conditioning (cFC) at 2 months of age in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 male mice, which could be reversed by the actin-polymerizing agent jasplakinolide. Further, the F-actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin induced recall deficit after cFC in WT mice, indicating the importance of maintaining F-/G-actin equilibrium for optimal behavioral response. Using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we show that F-actin depolymerization in spines leads to a breakdown of the nano-organization of outwardly radiating F-actin rods in cortical neurons from APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice. Our results demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction seen as F-actin disassembly occurs very early, before onset of pathological hallmarks in AD mice, and contributes to behavioral dysfunction, indicating that depolymerization of F-actin is causal and not consequent to decreased spine density. Further, we observed decreased synaptosomal F-actin levels in postmortem brain from mild cognitive impairment and AD patients compared with subjects with normal cognition. F-actin decrease correlated inversely with increasing AD pathology (Braak score, Aβ load, and tangle density) and directly with performance in episodic and working memory tasks, suggesting its role in human disease pathogenesis and progression.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cytoskeletal protein actin plays a critical role in maintaining structure and function of synapses. Using cultured neurons and an AD mouse model, we show for the first time that filamentous actin (F-actin) is lost selectively from synapses early in the disease process, long before the onset of classical AD pathology. We also demonstrate that loss of synaptic F-actin contributes directly to memory deficits. Loss of synaptosomal F-actin in human postmortem tissue correlates directly with decreased performance in memory test and inversely with AD pathology. Our data highlight that synaptic cytoarchitectural changes occur early in AD and they may be targeted for the development of therapeutics.",31/01/2018,1085-1099,J Neurosci,PubMed,PMID: 29246925 PMCID: PMC5792472,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246925,"Female; Humans; Male; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Mice; Actins; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Alzheimer Disease; cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; dementia; Aging; Autopsy; Mice, Transgenic; neurodegenerative disease; Cognition Disorders; Synaptosomes; Dendritic Spines; Mental Recall; Primary Cell Culture; Actin Depolymerizing Factors; Conditioning, Classical; cytoskeleton; Fear",

We quantified the contribution of 9 neuropathologies to cognitive loss at an individual level. METHODS: Participants (n = 1,079) came from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies of aging. All completed 2 + cognitive evaluations (maximum = 22), died, and underwent neuropathologic examinations to identify Alzheimer disease (AD), other neurodegenerative diseases, and vascular pathologies. Linear mixed models examined associations of neuropathologies with cognitive decline and estimated the proportion of cognitive loss accounted for by each neuropathology at a person-specific level. RESULTS: Neuropathology was ubiquitous, with 94% of participants having 1+, 78% having 2+, 58% having 3+, and 35% having 4+. AD was most frequent (65%) but rarely occurred in isolation (9%). Remarkably, >230 different neuropathologic combinations were observed, each of which occurred in <6% of the cohort. The relative contributions of specific neuropathologies to cognitive loss varied widely across individuals. Although AD accounted for an average of about 50% of the observed cognitive loss, the proportion accounted for at the individual level ranged widely from 22% to 100%. Lewy bodies and hippocampal sclerosis also had potent effects, but again their impacts varied at the person-specific level. INTERPRETATION: There is much greater heterogeneity in the comorbidity and cognitive impact of age-related neuropathologies than currently appreciated, suggesting an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that embrace the complexity of disease to combat cognitive decline in old age.

In CN and MCI individuals, we found that amyloid and total tau positivity systematically varies as a function of PHS. For individuals in greater than the 50th percentile PHS, the positive predictive value for amyloid approached 100%; for individuals in less than the 25th percentile PHS, the negative predictive value for total tau approached 85%. High PHS individuals with amyloid and tau pathology showed the steepest longitudinal cognitive and clinical decline, even among APOE ε4 noncarriers. Among the CN subgroup, we similarly found that PHS was strongly associated with amyloid positivity and the combination of PHS and biomarker status significantly predicted longitudinal clinical progression. In the ROSMAP cohort, higher PHS was associated with higher post-mortem amyloid load and neurofibrillary tangles, even in APOE ε4 noncarriers.

It is unclear whether these findings reflect differences in cognitive decline. METHODS: The Chicago Health and Aging Project followed individuals, 65+ years old (64% black, 36% white), for up to 18 years. Participants underwent triennial cognitive assessments; stratified randomized samples underwent assessments for AD. We compared black and white participants' cognitive performance, cognitive decline rate (N = 7,735), and AD incidence (N = 2,144), adjusting for age and sex. RESULTS: Black participants performed worse than white participants on the cognitive tests; 441 participants developed AD. Black participants' incident AD risk was twice that of whites (RR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.4, 2.7), with 58 excess cases/1,000 occurring among blacks (95% CI, 28, 88). Among noncarriers of APOE ε4, blacks had 2.3 times the AD risk (95% CI, 1.5, 3.6), but among carriers, race was not associated with risk (RR = 1.1; 95% CI, 0.6, 2.0; Pinteraction = 0.05). However, cognitive decline was not faster among blacks: the black-white difference in 5-year change in global cognitive score was 0.007 standard unit (95% CI, -0.034, 0.047). Years of education accounted for a sizable portion of racial disparities in cognitive level and AD risk, in analyses using a counterfactual approach. CONCLUSIONS: The higher risk of AD among blacks may stem from lower level of cognitive test performance persisting throughout the observation period rather than faster rate of late-life cognitive decline.

The association is replicated in an independent data set of 369 autopsies. The association of PTPRD with NFT is not dependent on the accumulation of amyloid pathology. In contrast, we found that the ZCWPW1 AD susceptibility variant influences NFT accumulation and that this effect is mediated by an accumulation of amyloid β plaques. We also performed complementary analyses to identify common pathways that influence multiple neuropathologies that coexist with NFT and found suggestive evidence that certain loci may influence multiple different neuropathological traits, including tau, amyloid β plaques, vascular injury and Lewy bodies. Overall, these analyses offer an evaluation of genetic susceptibility to NFT, a common end point for multiple different pathologic processes.",2018-06,1521-1529,Mol Psychiatry,PubMed,PMID: 28322283 PMCID: PMC5608624,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28322283,"Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Genome-Wide Association Study; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Plaque, Amyloid; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neurofibrillary Tangles; tau Proteins; Neurons; Neuropathology; Hippocampus; Prospective Studies; Tauopathies; Receptor-Like Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases, Class 2",

Often, however, the trajectory of cognitive function is nonlinear. For example, some participants may experience cognitive decline that accelerates as death approaches. Polynomial regression and piecewise linear models are common approaches used to characterize nonlinear trajectories, although both have assumptions that may not correspond with the actual trajectories. An alternative is to use a flexible sigmoidal mixed model based on the logistic family of curves. We describe a general class of such a model, which has up to five parameters, representing (1) final level, (2) rate of decline, (3) midpoint of decline, (4) initial level before decline, and (5) asymmetry. Focusing on a four-parameter symmetric sub-class of the model, with random effects on two of the parameters, we demonstrate that a likelihood approach to fitting this model produces accurate estimates of mean levels across time, even in the case of model misspecification. We also illustrate the method on deceased participants who had completed at least 5 years of annual cognitive testing and annual assessment of body mass.

METHODS: As part of a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study, 526 older persons (mean age at death = 90.9 years, 71% female) without dementia at baseline completed annual cognitive testing and were autopsied at death. Hospitalization information was obtained from linked Medicare claims records. Neuropathologic examination assessed β-amyloid burden, tau tangle density, neocortical Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, chronic gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts, and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa. RESULTS: Over a mean of 5.1 years, a total of 1,383 hospitalizations occurred, and the mean annual rate of hospitalization was 0.5 (standard deviation = 0.6, median = 0.4). Higher rate of hospitalization was not directly related to higher burden for any of the neuropathologic markers. Higher rate of hospitalization was associated with more rapid cognitive decline (estimate = -0.042, standard error [SE] = 0.012, p < 0.001), and after controlling for all 7 neuropathologic markers, the association was essentially the same (estimate = -0.040, SE = 0.013, p = 0.002). In a multivariable model with 3-way interactions of neuropathologic markers with hospitalization rate and time, the association between hospitalization rate and faster cognitive decline was greater in persons with more tangle pathology (estimate for interaction = -0.007, SE = 0.002, p = 0.002) and in persons with neocortical Lewy bodies (estimate for interaction = -0.117, SE = 0.042, p = 0.005).

However, the methods and results were not always consistent. This study aims to perform a coordinated analysis of latent trajectories of cognitive and functional progression in dementia across two datasets.

Trajectories of cognition and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) were modeled jointly in a parallel-process growth mixture model. RESULTS: Cognition and IADL tended to decline in unison across the two samples. Slow decline in both domains was observed in 26% of the US sample and 74% of the Dutch sample. Rapid decline in cognition and IADL was observed in 7% of the US sample and 26% of the Dutch sample. The majority (67%) of the US sample showed moderate cognitive decline and rapid IADL decline. CONCLUSIONS: Trajectories of slow and rapid dementia progression were identified in both samples. Despite using the same statistical methods, the number of latent trajectories was not replicated and the relative class sizes differed considerably across datasets.

In humans, the importance of this effect has remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close relatives is both rare and frequently associated with confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding coefficients (FROH) for >1.4 million individuals, we show that FROH is significantly associated (p < 0.0005) with apparently deleterious changes in 32 out of 100 traits analysed. These changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly rare. The effect on fertility is striking: FROH equivalent to the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55% decrease [95% CI 44-66%] in the odds of having children.

OBSERVATIONS: Dementia is an acquired loss of cognition in multiple cognitive domains sufficiently severe to affect social or occupational function. In the United States, Alzheimer disease, one cause of dementia, affects 5.8 million people. Dementia is commonly associated with more than 1 neuropathology, usually Alzheimer disease with cerebrovascular pathology. Diagnosing dementia requires a history evaluating for cognitive decline and impairment in daily activities, with corroboration from a close friend or family member, in addition to a thorough mental status examination by a clinician to delineate impairments in memory, language, attention, visuospatial cognition such as spatial orientation, executive function, and mood. Brief cognitive impairment screening questionnaires can assist in initiating and organizing the cognitive assessment. However, if the assessment is inconclusive (eg, symptoms present, but normal examination findings), neuropsychological testing can help determine whether dementia is present. Physical examination may help identify the etiology of dementia. For example, focal neurologic abnormalities suggest stroke. Brain neuroimaging may demonstrate structural changes including, but not limited to, focal atrophy, infarcts, and tumor, that may not be identified on physical examination. Additional evaluation with cerebrospinal fluid assays or genetic testing may be considered in atypical dementia cases, such as age of onset younger than 65 years, rapid symptom onset, and/or impairment in multiple cognitive domains but not episodic memory. For treatment, patients may benefit from nonpharmacologic approaches, including cognitively engaging activities such as reading, physical exercise such as walking, and socialization such as family gatherings. Pharmacologic approaches can provide modest symptomatic relief. For Alzheimer disease, this includes an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor such as donepezil for mild to severe dementia, and memantine (used alone or as an add-on therapy) for moderate to severe dementia. Rivastigmine can be used to treat symptomatic Parkinson disease dementia. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Alzheimer disease currently affects 5.8 million persons in the United States and is a common cause of dementia, which is usually accompanied by other neuropathology, often cerebrovascular disease such as brain infarcts. Causes of dementia can be diagnosed by medical history, cognitive and physical examination, laboratory testing, and brain imaging.

However, the degree to which genetic risk of Alzheimer's dementia contributes to late-life motor impairment, and the specific molecular systems underlying these associations, are uncertain. Here, we adopted an integrative multi-omic approach to assess genetic influence on motor impairment in older adults and identified key molecular pathways that may mediate this risk. We built a polygenic risk score for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (AD-PRS) and examined its relationship to several motor phenotypes in 1885 older individuals from two longitudinal aging cohorts. We found that AD-PRS was associated with a previously validated composite motor scores and their components. The major genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's dementia, the APOE/TOMM40 locus, was not a major driver of these associations. To identify specific molecular features that potentially medicate the genetic risk into motor dysfunction, we examined brain multi-omics, including transcriptome, DNA methylation, histone acetylation (H3K9AC), and targeted proteomics, as well as diverse neuropathologies. We found that a small number of factors account for the majority of the influence of AD-PRS on motor function, which comprises paired helical filament tau-tangle density, H3K9AC in specific chromosomal regions encoding genes involved in neuromuscular process.

We examined the extent to which common age-related neuropathologies including Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease (AD) contribute to yearly variability in late life cognition. METHODS: Data came from 1321 community-dwelling older adults who were followed annually for up to 23 years, died and underwent brain autopsy. Cognition was assessed via a comprehensive testing battery. Uniform neuropathologic evaluations assessed burdens of Lewy bodies, AD, infarcts, TDP, hippocampal sclerosis, amyloid angiopathy, atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis. Using mixed effects models, yearly variability in cognition, characterized as within-person variability of annual cognitive scores, was regressed on the nine neuropathologic indices. RESULTS: The average age of decedents was 90 years and 69% were female. At autopsy, about two thirds met the pathologic criteria for AD. Neocortical Lewy bodies were present in 13% of the individuals. Other neuropathologic conditions also were common. All neuropathologic indices except for microinfarcts were associated with cognitive decline. Individuals with neocortical Lewy bodies had almost twice the yearly variability in cognition compared to those without. Individuals with AD had about 70% more variability compared to those without. Yearly variability was present among persons with vascular diseases but to a lesser degree than neocortical Lewy bodies and AD.

Here we show that extended longevity in humans is associated with a distinct transcriptome signature in the cerebral cortex that is characterized by downregulation of genes related to neural excitation and synaptic function. In Caenorhabditis elegans, neural excitation increases with age and inhibition of excitation globally, or in glutamatergic or cholinergic neurons, increases longevity. Furthermore, longevity is dynamically regulated by the excitatory-inhibitory balance of neural circuits. The transcription factor REST is upregulated in humans with extended longevity and represses excitation-related genes. Notably, REST-deficient mice exhibit increased cortical activity and neuronal excitability during ageing. Similarly, loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans REST orthologue genes spr-3 and spr-4 elevate neural excitation and reduce the lifespan of long-lived daf-2 mutants. In wild-type worms, overexpression of spr-4 suppresses excitation and extends lifespan. REST, SPR-3, SPR-4 and reduced excitation activate the longevity-associated transcription factors FOXO1 and DAF-16 in mammals and worms, respectively.

METHOD: Data from the initial administration of the MINT were obtained on NACC participants who were cognitively normal (N = 3,981) or diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (N = 852) or dementia (N = 1,148) with presumed etiology of AD. Dementia severity was rated using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. RESULTS: Cross-sectional multiple regression analyses revealed significant effects of diagnostic group, sex, education, age, and race on naming scores. Planned comparisons collapsing across age and education groups revealed significant group differences in naming scores across levels of dementia severity. ROC curve analyses showed good diagnostic accuracy of MINT scores for distinguishing cognitively normal controls from AD dementia, but not from MCI. Within the cognitively normal group, there was a robust interaction between age and education such that naming scores exhibited the most precipitous drop across age groups for the least educated participants. Additionally, education effects were stronger in African-Americans than in Whites (a race-by-education interaction), and race effects were stronger in older than in younger age groups (a race-by-age interaction).

METHODS: We modeled neuropsychiatric inventory questionnaire (NPI-Q) scores from 4184 volunteers over approximately 4 years using growth mixture models, generating latent classes of trajectory. We then fit Cox proportional hazard models to determine if membership in trajectory classes was associated with increased hazard of diagnosis of MCI or dementia. RESULTS: We identified four trajectory classes: the majority of the sample (65%) would be expected to belong to a class with consistently low or zero NPS. The next most prevalent class, (16%) showed a decrease over time in NPI-Q total score but, compared with the majority class had an almost threefold increase in hazard of MCI or dementia (HR: 2.92; 95% CI: 1.82-4.68).

METHODS: Neuropsychological test data from patients with mild to moderate probable AD (n = 4,711) were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center. Inclusion and exclusion criteria usually used in AD clinical trials were applied. Principal component analysis and model-based clustering were used to identify cognitive profiles in a subset of patients with autopsy-verified AD (n = 800) and validated in the overall (nonautopsy) sample and an independent cohort with similar test data. Relationships between cognitive profile, clinical characteristics, and rate of decline were examined with mixed-effects models. RESULTS: In the autopsy-confirmed sample, 79.6% of patients had a typical AD cognitive profile (greater impairment of episodic memory than other cognitive functions), and 20.4% had an atypical profile (comparable impairment across cognitive domains). Similar results were obtained in the overall (typical 79.8%, atypical 20.2%) and validation (typical 71.8%, atypical 28.2%) samples. Atypicality was associated with younger age, male sex, lower probability of APOE ε4, less severe global dementia, higher depression scores, lower Braak stage at autopsy, and slower cognitive decline.

This study leveraged the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set to longitudinally examine the association between white matter hyperintensities and neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, and functional decline among participants with normal cognition. METHODS: The sample included 465 participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set who had quantitated volume of white matter hyperintensities from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery MRI, had normal cognition at the time of their MRI, and were administered the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set neuropsychological test battery within 1 year of study evaluation and had at least two post-MRI time points of clinical data. Neuropsychiatric status was assessed by the Geriatric Depression Scale-15 and Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Questionnaire. Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes defined functional status.

RESULTS: Based on combined ethnicity norms, the scores of Black participants were overrepresented in the below-average and low-average clinical ranges, and the scores of White participants were overrepresented in the high-average and superior clinical ranges for all 11 neuropsychological measures. When group specific norms were used, the unbalanced pattern of score categorization was no longer present for any of the neuropsychological measures. CONCLUSIONS: These findings emphasize the importance of developing and using ethnically and culturally appropriate neuropsychological test norms as well as the risk of interpreting some Black individual's scores as below average when they likely are not.

To better understand disease, new multi-omic data-sets have recently been generated with the goal of identifying molecular causes of disease. However, most analytic studies using these datasets focus on uni-modal analysis of the data. Here, we propose a data driven approach to integrate multiple data types and analytic outcomes to aggregate evidences to support the hypothesis that a gene is a genetic driver of the disease. The main algorithmic contributions of our article are: (i) a general machine learning framework to learn the key characteristics of a few known driver genes from multiple feature sets and identifying other potential driver genes which have similar feature representations, and (ii) A flexible ranking scheme with the ability to integrate external validation in the form of Genome Wide Association Study summary statistics. While we currently focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach using different analytic outcomes from RNA-Seq studies, this method is easily generalizable to other data modalities and analysis types. RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility of our machine learning algorithm on two benchmark multiview datasets by significantly outperforming the baseline approaches in predicting missing labels. We then use the algorithm to predict and rank potential drivers of Alzheimer's. We show that our ranked genes show a significant enrichment for single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with Alzheimer's and are enriched in pathways that have been previously associated with the disease.

Thus, we investigated the presumptive primary and contributing diagnoses in individuals who had cognitive impairment while alive and who met neuropathologic criteria for PART at autopsy. We also compared these clinical diagnoses for people with PART to those with AD neuropathology (ADNP). We used data on 1354 participants from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center, restricting to those with no neuritic plaques (PART) or moderate/frequent neuritic plaques (ADNP); clinical visit within two years of autopsy; and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia at last visit. To assess if PART participants were less likely to receive a clinical diagnosis of AD at their last visit prior to autopsy, we used logistic regression, controlling for age, sex, education, and APOE ε4 status. There were 161 PART individuals (n = 49 MCI; n = 112 dementia) and 1193 individuals with ADNP (n = 75 MCI; n = 1118 dementia).

In the adjusted analysis, primary and contributing clinical diagnoses of AD remained less likely in PART vs. ADNP participants with dementia (OR: 0.22, 95% CI: 0.13-0.38). This study suggests that clinicians recognize a distinction in the clinical presentation between PART and ADNP, diagnosing AD less frequently in those with PART.

Our previous analysis demonstrated that genetic factors vary across cognitively-defined LOAD groups. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether risks associated with depression and traumatic brain injury with loss of consciousness (TBI) for cognitively defined LOAD subgroups are similar. METHODS: We used cognitive data at LOAD diagnosis from three prospective cohort studies to determine cognitively-defined subgroups. We compared subgroups in endorsement of items from the Centers for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale and history of TBI. RESULTS: Among 1,505 people with LOAD from the three studies, there were substantial differences across subgroups in total CES-D score, with lower scores (less depression) for people with AD with relative impairments in memory (AD-Memory) compared to those in other groups. Differences were noteworthy for the sleep-related item of the CES-D, as people with AD-Memory were less likely to report restless sleep than people in other groups. There were no differences in TBI history across groups.

By using the gene expression imputation models fitted from reference datasets that have both genetic and transcriptomic data, TWASs facilitate gene-based tests with GWAS data while accounting for the reference transcriptomic data. The existing TWAS tools like PrediXcan and FUSION use parametric imputation models that have limitations for modeling the complex genetic architecture of transcriptomic data. Therefore, to improve on this, we employ a nonparametric Bayesian method that was originally proposed for genetic prediction of complex traits, which assumes a data-driven nonparametric prior for cis-eQTL effect sizes. The nonparametric Bayesian method is flexible and general because it includes both of the parametric imputation models used by PrediXcan and FUSION as special cases. Our simulation studies showed that the nonparametric Bayesian model improved both imputation R2 for transcriptomic data and the TWAS power over PrediXcan when ≥1% cis-SNPs co-regulate gene expression and gene expression heritability ≤0.2. In real applications, the nonparametric Bayesian method fitted transcriptomic imputation models for 57.8% more genes over PrediXcan, thus improving the power of follow-up TWASs.

The use of multiple medications increases the likelihood that a patient will experience potential drug interactions and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Those individuals with dementia or Alzheimer's disease (AD) are at greater risk, due to age, comorbidities, and an increased likelihood of being on a greater number of neuroactive medications. METHODS: uMETHOD Health (uMH) has developed a precision medicine platform to address dementia and mild AD through the creation of personalized, multidomain treatment plans. Many interactions and ADRs may be observed, such as drug-drug interactions (DDIs), drug-gene interactions (DGIs), anticholinergic cognitive burden (ACB), and depression-inducing drugs (DIDs). uMH's algorithms can parse these interactions, rate them based on input from open-source databases, and then record all these interactions in a generated treatment plan. A total of 295 individuals aged 65 and older were included in this analysis. RESULTS: Of 295 individuals, 97.59% were on at least one medication, with an overall mean of 11.5 medications per person; 83.66% were on five or more medications. A total of 102 DGIs, 3642 DDIs, and one high-priority DDI were found in this population. There was a significant increase in the number of DDIs as medications per person increased (P value < 0.0001). Of the population, 65.86% were on one or more anticholinergic drugs. There was a significant difference in the ACB score between individuals with cognitive decline and those without. In total, 60.98% of the overall population were on DIDs, with a mean of 1.19 medications per person. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this work show that older populations have a high medication burden. With the growing elderly and AD populations, medication management for polypharmacy is a need that grows direr every year. uMH's platform was able to identify a multitude of polypharmacy problems that individuals are currently facing.

Cortical histone deacetylase (HDAC) dysregulation has been associated with neuronal degeneration during AD progression. However, whether HDAC alterations play a role in CBF degeneration during AD onset is unknown. We investigated global HDAC protein levels and nuclear HDAC2 immunoreactivity in tissue containing the nbM, changes and their association with neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) during the progression of AD. METHODS: We used semi-quantitative western blotting and immunohistochemistry to evaluate HDAC and sirtuin (SIRT) levels in individuals that died with a premortem clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild/moderate AD (mAD) or severe AD (sAD). Quantitative immunohistochemistry was used to identify HDAC2 protein levels in individual cholinergic nbM nuclei and their colocalization with the early phosphorylated tau marker AT8, the late-stage apoptotic tau marker TauC3 and Thioflavin-S, a marker of β-pleated sheet structures in NFTs. RESULTS: In AD patients, HDAC2 protein levels were dysregulated in the basal forebrain region containing cholinergic neurons of the nbM. HDAC2 nuclear immunoreactivity was reduced in individual cholinergic nbM neurons across disease stages. HDAC2 nuclear reactivity correlated with multiple cognitive domains and with NFT formation.

Given that the 'oldest-old' are at greatest risk for LATE-NC, and subjects of advanced age constitute a rapidly growing demographic group in many countries, LATE has an expanding but under-recognized impact on public health. For these reasons, a working group was convened to develop diagnostic criteria for LATE, aiming both to stimulate research and to promote awareness of this pathway to dementia. We report consensus-based recommendations including guidelines for diagnosis and staging of LATE-NC. For routine autopsy workup of LATE-NC, an anatomically-based preliminary staging scheme is proposed with TDP-43 immunohistochemistry on tissue from three brain areas, reflecting a hierarchical pattern of brain involvement: amygdala, hippocampus, and middle frontal gyrus. LATE-NC appears to affect the medial temporal lobe structures preferentially, but other areas also are impacted. Neuroimaging studies demonstrated that subjects with LATE-NC also had atrophy in the medial temporal lobes, frontal cortex, and other brain regions. Genetic studies have thus far indicated five genes with risk alleles for LATE-NC: GRN, TMEM106B, ABCC9, KCNMB2, and APOE. The discovery of these genetic risk variants indicate that LATE shares pathogenetic mechanisms with both frontotemporal lobar degeneration and Alzheimer's disease, but also suggests disease-specific underlying mechanisms. Large gaps remain in our understanding of LATE. For advances in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment, there is an urgent need for research focused on LATE, including in vitro and animal models. An obstacle to clinical progress is lack of diagnostic tools, such as biofluid or neuroimaging biomarkers, for ante-mortem detection of LATE. Development of a disease biomarker would augment observational studies seeking to further define the risk factors, natural history, and clinical features of LATE, as well as eventual subject recruitment for targeted therapies in clinical trials.",01/06/2019,1503-1527,Brain,PubMed,PMID: 31039256 PMCID: PMC6536849,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31039256,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; FTLD; Neuroimaging; MRI; TDP-43 Proteinopathies; Retrospective Studies; epidemiology; Frontotemporal Dementia; Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; Brain Diseases; PET; SNAP",

METHODS: This longitudinal, clinical-pathologic study (aPL antibodies, brain infarcts, and cognitive and motor decline in aging), was derived from 2 ongoing community-based cohort studies. A panel of 3 aPL antibodies was assayed in serum from 956 older individuals (mean age = 81.1 years; 72% women). Serum was also tested in a subset for markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein [CRP]) and blood-brain barrier breakdown (matrix metalloproteinases, MMPs). Annual clinical evaluations documented cognitive (17 neuropsychological tests) and motor function including parkinsonism. Cerebrovascular disease data were derived from in vivo neuroimaging and postmortem neuropathologic evaluations (699 individuals). We examined associations of aPL with cognitive and motor decline, other serum markers, neuroimaging, and neuropathology.

Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing can improve the understanding of the causes of LOAD and provide initial steps required to identify potential therapeutic targets. OBJECTIVE: To identify the genetic loci for LOAD across different ethnic groups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was designed to analyze whole-exome sequencing data from a multiethnic cohort using a transethnic gene-kernel association test meta-analysis, adjusted for sex, age, and principal components, to identify genetic variants associated with LOAD. A meta-analysis was conducted on the results of 2 independent studies of whole-exome and whole-genome sequence data from individuals of European ancestry. This group of European American, African American, and Caribbean Hispanic individuals participating in an urban population-based study were the discovery cohort; the additional cohorts included affected individuals and control participants from 2 publicly available data sets. Replication was achieved using independent data sets from Caribbean Hispanic families with multiple family members affected by LOAD and the International Genetics of Alzheimer Project. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Late-onset Alzheimer disease. RESULTS: The discovery cohort included 3595 affected individuals, while the additional cohorts included 5931 individuals with LOAD and 5504 control participants. Of 3916 individuals in the discovery cohort, we included 3595 individuals (1397 with LOAD and 2198 cognitively healthy controls; 2451 [68.2%] women; mean [SD] age, 80.3 [6.83] years). Another 321 individuals (8.2%) were excluded because of non-LOAD diagnosis, age younger than 60 years, missing covariates, duplicate data, or genetic outlier status. Gene-based tests that compared affected individuals (n = 7328) and control participants (n = 7702) and included only rare and uncommon variants annotated as having moderate-high functional effect supported PINX1 (8p23.1) as a locus with gene-wide significance (P = 2.81 × 10-6) after meta-analysis across the 3 studies.

Therefore, we aimed to assess the prevalence and characteristics of motor signs in autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease. Baseline Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale part three scores (UPDRS-III) from 433 participants of the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network observational study were analysed. Motor symptoms were scrutinized with respect to associations with mutation carrier status, mutation site within PSEN1, basal ganglia amyloid-β as measured by Pittsburgh compound B PET, estimated years to symptom onset and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes. Motor findings in mutation carriers were compared to patients with sporadic Alzheimer's disease using data of the National Alzheimer's Coordination Center. Mutation carriers showed motor findings at a higher frequency (28.4% versus 12.8%; P < 0.001) and severity (mean UPDRS-III scores 2.0 versus 0.4; P < 0.001) compared to non-carriers. Eleven of the 27 UPDRS-III items were statistically more frequently affected in mutation carriers after adjustment for multiple comparisons. Ten of these 11 items were subscale components of bradykinesia. In cognitively asymptomatic mutation carriers, dysdiadochokinesia was more frequent compared to non-carriers (right hand: 3.8% versus 0%; adjusted P = 0.023; left: 4.4% versus 0.6%; adjusted P = 0.031). In this cohort, the positive predictive value for mutation carrier status in cognitively asymptomatic participants (50% a priori risk) of dysdiadochokinesia was 100% for the right and 87.5% for the left side. Mutation carriers with motor findings more frequently were basal ganglia amyloid-β positive (84% versus 63.3%; P = 0.006) and showed more basal ganglia amyloid-β deposition (Pittsburgh compound B-standardized uptake value ratio 2.472 versus 1.928; P = 0.002) than those without.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations of cortical β-amyloid protein in the absence of insoluble deposits with cognitive decline, neurofibrillary tangles, other age-associated neuropathologic conditions, and APOE. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This analysis combines data from 2 community-based clinicopathologic cohort studies of aging. The Religious Orders Study started in 1994, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project started in 1997. Both studies are ongoing. Participants without known dementia were enrolled and agreed to annual clinical evaluations and brain donation after death. Primary analyses focused on individuals without β-amyloid deposits. Data analyses occurred in mid-September 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: β-Amyloid protein abundance was measured by targeted proteomics using selected reaction monitoring. β-Amyloid deposits were detected using immunohistochemistry. Other neuropathologic indices were quantified via uniform structured evaluation. Linear mixed models were used to examine the association of β-amyloid protein with cognitive decline. Regression models examined the protein associations with neuropathologic outcomes and the APOE genotype. RESULTS: By mid-September 2018, 3575 older persons were enrolled, and 1559 had died and undergone brain autopsy. Proteomic data were collected in 1208 individuals, and 5 with missing cognitive scores were excluded. Of the remaining 1203, primary analyses focused on 148 individuals (12.3%) without β-amyloid deposits. In this group, the mean (SD) age at death was 87.0 (7.0) years, and 84 individuals (56.8%) were women. In the absence of β-amyloid deposits, we did not observe an association of β-amyloid protein with decline in episodic memory, but the protein was associated with faster rates of decline in processing speed (mean [SE] change, -0.014 [0.005]; P = .008) and visuospatial abilities (mean [SE] change, -0.013 [0.005]; P = .006). We did not observe protein association with paired helical filament tau tangle density. The protein was associated with amyloid angiopathy (odds ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.15-1.67]; P < .001) but no other brain pathology. The associations with cognitive decline were unchanged after controlling for amyloid angiopathy. Neither APOE ε4 nor a polygenic Alzheimer risk score was associated with β-amyloid protein. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cortical β-amyloid protein was associated with faster cognitive decline in the absence of β-amyloid deposits, which supports the role of cortical soluble β-amyloid as a neurotoxic agent in aging.

We find that constructing confidence intervals using multiple imputation based on logistic regression gives the most robust coverage probability and the choice of confidence interval method is less important.

METHODS: Data from 2242 individuals, clinically diagnosed with MCI-AD [Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), 0 or 0.5] or with mild ADdem (CDR, 0.5 or 1), were available from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's (NACC) Uniform Data Set (UDS). General linear mixed models were used to examine the annual change in the CDR Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) and in neuropsychological performance. We compared slopes before and after ChEI initiation among ChEI users, and also compared the change in scores of ChEI users versus nonusers. RESULTS: Thirty-four percent of 944 MCI-AD and 72% of 1298 ADdem participants were ChEI users. Cognitive decline was greater after ChEI initiation in MCI-AD and ADdem groups (eg, MCI-AD, CDR-SB: 0.03 points/y before initiation; 0.61 points/y after initiation, P<0.0001). Both MCI-AD and ADdem groups had faster decline after ChEI initiation than nonusers (eg, MCI-AD, CDR-SB: 0.61 points/y, ChEI users; 0.24 points/y, nonusers, P<0.0001).

Mechanisms linking depression with cognition are poorly understood. We hypothesize that the association of depressive symptoms with cognition is mediated or modified by brain proteins. METHODS: IGFBP-5, HSPB2, AK4, ITPK1 and PLXNB1 were measured in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in 1057 deceased participants, who underwent annual assessments of depressive symptoms and cognition for a mean of 8.9 years. The average number of depressive symptoms per year before a dementia diagnosis was calculated for each person. RESULTS: A one standard deviation above the mean IGFBP-5 was associated with a 14% higher odds of having more depressive symptoms (p < 0.031). Higher IGFBP-5 was associated with faster decline in global cognition (p < 0.001) and five cognitive domains (p < 0.008), controlling for depressive symptoms. IGFBP-5 moderated the association of depressive symptoms with decline in global cognition (p = 0.045). IGFBP-5 mediated ten percent or less of the total effect of depressive symptoms on decline in global cognition and the cognitive domains (p > 0.070). LIMITATIONS: Participants were volunteers and self-selection bias limits the generalizability of our findings. In addition, we used self-reported data on depressive symptoms. However, we also used data on depression medications as sensitivity analyses to confirm findings. CONCLUSIONS: In old age, brain IGFBP-5 is associated with depressive symptoms and cognition.

We previously constructed a probabilistic causal network model of sporadic LOAD and identified TYROBP/DAP12, encoding a microglial transmembrane signaling polypeptide and direct adapter of TREM2, as the most robust key driver gene in the network. Here, we show that absence of TYROBP/DAP12 in a mouse model of AD-type cerebral Aβ amyloidosis (APPKM670/671NL/PSEN1Δexon9) recapitulates the expected network characteristics by normalizing the transcriptome of APP/PSEN1 mice and repressing the induction of genes involved in the switch from homeostatic microglia to disease-associated microglia (DAM), including Trem2, complement (C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, and Itgax), Clec7a and Cst7. Importantly, we show that constitutive absence of TYROBP/DAP12 in the amyloidosis mouse model prevented appearance of the electrophysiological and learning behavior alterations associated with the phenotype of APPKM670/671NL/PSEN1Δexon9 mice. Our results suggest that TYROBP/DAP12 could represent a novel therapeutic target to slow, arrest, or prevent the development of sporadic LOAD.

Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Aβ processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD.

A better understanding of the relationships among these variables would help clarify whether sedentary time should be considered more closely in older adults at particular levels of kidney function to reduce the risk of WMH. METHODS: We analyzed information from 94 healthy community-dwelling older adults to determine the association of sedentary time and WMH in nondemented, nondepressed older adults, and whether level of kidney function was an effect modifier of the relationship between sedentary time and WMH. Sedentary behavior was measured using the Sedentary Behavior Questionnaire. White matter hyperintensity was assessed using whole-brain 3T magnetic resonance imaging T1- and T2-weighted images. Kidney function was calculated by the epi-chronic kidney disease formula for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Exposures or predictors were sedentary time, age, sex, education in years, Framingham stroke risk 10-yr prediction score, and eGFR. The analytical approach was multiple linear regression. RESULTS: Adjusting for age, sex, education in years, Framingham stroke risk 10-yr prediction score, greater sedentary time was associated with greater WMH but this effect was dependent on level of eGFR (sedentary time-eGFR interaction b = -0.0005, P = 0.022). At eGFR values of 69, 81, and 93 mL·min per 1.73 m (the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles), sedentary time b coefficients were b = 0.021 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.011-0.031), b = 0.015 (95% CI, 0.008-0.022), and b = 0.009 (95% CI, 0.003-0.016). The effect weakened linearly as eGFR increased, with no significant association at eGFR ≥97 mL·min per 1.73 m.

However, the specific role of brain microvascular cells in these anomalies remains elusive. In this study, we validated by Western, ELISA and immunofluorescence analyses a procedure to generate microvasculature-enriched fractions from frozen samples of human cerebral cortex. We then investigated Aβ and proteins involved in its clearance or production in microvessel extracts generated from the parietal cortex of 60 volunteers in the Religious Orders Study. Volunteers were categorized as AD (n = 38) or controls (n = 22) based on the ABC scoring method presented in the revised guidelines for the neuropathological diagnosis of AD. Higher ELISA-determined concentrations of vascular Aβ40 and Aβ42 were found in persons with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD, in apoE4 carriers and in participants with advanced parenchymal CAA, compared to respective age-matched controls. Vascular levels of two proteins involved in Aβ clearance, ABCB1 and neprilysin, were lower in persons with AD and positively correlated with cognitive function, while being inversely correlated to vascular Aβ40. In contrast, BACE1, a protein necessary for Aβ production, was increased in individuals with AD and in apoE4 carriers, negatively correlated to cognitive function and positively correlated to Aβ40 in microvessel extracts. The present report indicates that concentrating microvessels from frozen human brain samples facilitates the quantitative biochemical analysis of cerebrovascular dysfunction in CNS disorders. Data generated overall show that microvessels extracted from individuals with parenchymal CAA-AD contained more Aβ and BACE1 and less ABCB1 and neprilysin, evidencing a pattern of dysfunction in brain microvascular cells contributing to CAA and AD pathology and symptoms.",2019-05,801-823,Acta Neuropathol,PubMed,PMID: 30729296 PMCID: PMC6483878,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30729296,"Alzheimer’s disease; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Longitudinal Studies; Apolipoproteins E; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Parietal Lobe; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter, Subfamily B; Cerebral amyloid angiopathy; Neprilysin; Beta-amyloid; Blood–brain barrier; Brain microvascular cells; Microvessels",

METHODS: Analyses are based on older participants in a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study who had annual cognitive testing (n = 2,899) and subgroups that developed incident dementia (n = 696), died, and underwent a neuropathologic examination from which 10 neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular markers were derived (n = 752), or both (n = 405).

In all participants, education was associated with initial level of global cognition but not rate of cognitive change. In those who developed dementia, rate of global cognitive decline accelerated a mean of 1.8 years before the diagnosis, but education was not related to the onset or rate of accelerated decline. In the deceased, rate of global cognitive decline accelerated a mean of 3.4 years before death, but higher educational attainment was related to earlier (not later) onset of accelerated decline and unrelated to rate of acceleration. Higher education was associated with lower likelihood of gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts but not with other neuropathologic markers.

METHODS: At annual intervals for up to 21 years, 915 older participants in a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study completed a battery of 15 tests from which previously established composite measures of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed were derived. At death, they underwent a neuropathologic examination to quantify Alzheimer disease pathology, Lewy bodies, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, and hippocampal sclerosis plus multiple markers of cerebrovascular disease. Time-varying effect models were used to assess change over time in the relation of neuropathologic markers to cognitive trajectories. RESULTS: Controlling for pathology, decline in perceptual speed was evident about 15 years before death; modest decline in semantic and working memory occurred later; and there was little change in episodic memory. Each neurodegenerative marker was associated with lower episodic memory function beginning about 10 to 16 years before death. As time before death decreased, Alzheimer disease pathology, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis were associated with impairment in other cognitive domains but the association of TDP-43 pathology with cognition continued to be mainly confined to episodic memory.

RESULTS: Of 777 participants, 460 (59.2%) were hospitalized over a mean of 5.0 (SD = 2.6) years; 222 (28.6%) had at least one elective and 418 (53.8%) at least one nonelective hospitalization. Mixed-effects regression models estimated change in global cognition before and after each type of hospitalization compared to no hospitalization, adjusted for age, sex, education, medical conditions, length of stay, surgery, intensive care unit, and comorbidities. Persons who were not hospitalized had a mean loss of 0.051 unit global cognition per year. In comparison, there was no significant difference in rate of decline before (0.044 unit per year) or after (0.048 unit per year) elective hospitalizations. In contrast, decline before nonelective hospitalization was faster (0.076 unit per year; estimate = -0.024, SE = 0.011, p = 0.032), and accelerated by 0.036 unit (SE = 0.005, p < 0.001) to mean loss of 0.112 unit per year after nonelective hospitalizations, more than doubling the rate in those not hospitalized.

We conducted an epigenome-wide association study using the histone 3 lysine 9 acetylation (H3K9ac) mark in 669 aged human prefrontal cortices; in contrast with amyloid-β, tau protein burden had a broad effect on the epigenome, affecting 5,990 of 26,384 H3K9ac domains. Tau-related alterations aggregated in large genomic segments reflecting spatial chromatin organization, and the magnitude of these effects correlated with the segment's nuclear lamina association. Functional relevance of these chromatin changes was demonstrated by (1) consistent transcriptional changes in three independent datasets and (2) similar findings in two mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we found that tau overexpression in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons altered chromatin structure and that these effects could be blocked by a small molecule predicted to reverse the tau effect.

METHODS: Within the Rush Memory and Aging Project, 380 dementia-free participants (mean age = 78 years) were followed for up to 15 years, and underwent MRI scans. Olfactory function was assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT) at baseline, and categorized as anosmia (B-SIT <6), hyposmia (B-SIT 6-10 in men and 6-10.25 in women), and normal (B-SIT 10.25-12 in men and 10.5-12 in women). Cognitive function was annually assessed with a battery of 21 tests, from which composite scores were derived. Structural total and regional brain volumes were estimated. Data were analyzed using linear regression and mixed-effects models. RESULTS: At study entry, 138 (36.3%) had normal olfactory function, 213 (56.1%) had hyposmia, and 29 (7.6%) had anosmia.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between APOE genotype, Lewy body pathology, and abnormal sleep patterns in a large group of subjects with known AD load evaluated upon autopsy. METHOD: Data from 2,368 cases obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Centre database were categorized as follows: Braak Stage V/VI and CERAD frequent neuritic plaques as high load AD, Braak Stage III/IV and moderate CERAD as intermediate load AD, and Braak Stage 0/I/II and infrequent CERAD as no to low load AD. Cases discrepant between the two measures were discarded. RESULTS: Disrupted sleep was more frequent in males (42.4%) compared to females (35.1%), and in carriers (42.3%) as opposed to non-carriers (36.5%) of ε4. Amongst female subjects with high AD load and Lewy body pathology, homozygous (ε4/ε4) carriers experienced disrupted sleep more often compared with heterozygous (ε4/x) or non-carriers of ε4. Such recessive, gender-specific, and Lewy body association is reminiscent of the ε4 effect on psychosis in AD. However, such association was lost after adjusting for covariates.

Both transcript and protein data indicate that cholinotrophic neuronal dysfunction is related to an imbalance between TrkA-mediated survival signaling and the NGF precursor (proNGF)/p75NTR-mediated pro-apoptotic signaling, which may be related to alteration in the metabolism of NGF. Data indicate a spatiotemporal pattern of degeneration related to the evolution of tau pathology within cholinotrophic neuronal subgroups located within the nucleus basalis of Meynert (nbM). Despite these degenerative events the cholinotrophic system is capable of cellular resilience and/or plasticity during the prodromal and later stages of the disease. In addition to neurotrophin dysfunction, studies indicate alterations in epigenetically regulated proteins occur within cholinotrophic nbM neurons during the progression of AD, suggesting a mechanism that may underlie changes in transcript expression. Findings that increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of proNGF mark the onset of MCI and the transition to AD suggests that this proneurotrophin is a potential disease biomarker. Novel therapeutics to treat NGF dysfunction include NGF gene therapy and the development of small molecule agonists for the cognate prosurvival NGF receptor TrkA and antagonists against the pan-neurotrophin p75NTR death receptor for the treatment of AD.",11/07/2005,533,Front Neurosci,PubMed,PMID: 31312116 PMCID: PMC6613497,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31312116,Alzheimer; epigenetics; mild cognitive impairment; biomarker; nerve growth factor; neurotrophin receptors,

However, it is unknown whether similar findings are present in non-demented elderly subjects. OBJECTIVE: This study determined the association between CAA and cognition among elderly NCI subjects with varying levels of AD pathology. METHODS: Data from 182 cases that received a diagnosis of NCI at their first clinical assessment were obtained from the Rush Religious Orders study (RROS). A cognitive composite score was used to measure cognitive decline. CAA was dichotomized as present or absent. Cases were also dichotomized according to CERAD neuropathological diagnosis and Braak staging. A mixed model-repeated measures analysis assessed decline on the cognitive composite score. RESULTS: CAA, alone, was not associated with cognitive decline [-0.87 (95% CI: -3.33, 1.58), p = 0.49]. However, among those with CAA, the High CERAD group had significantly greater decline relative to the Low CERAD group [-4.08 (95% CI: -7.10, -1.06), p = 0.008]. The High and Low CERAD groups were not significantly different [-1.77 (95% CI: -6.14, 2.60), p = 0.43] in those without CAA.

These findings raise the possibility that brain-derived EV's present in blood can be used to monitor disease processes occurring in the cerebrum. Since the levels of certain micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been reported to be altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, we sought to assess miRNA dysregulation in AD brain tissue and to determine if these changes were reflected in neural EVs isolated from blood of subjects with AD. To this end, we employed high-content miRNA arrays to search for differences in miRNAs in RNA pools from brain tissue of AD (n = 5), high pathological control (HPC) (n = 5), or cognitively intact pathology-free controls (n = 5). Twelve miRNAs were altered by >1.5-fold in AD compared to controls, and six of these were also changed compared to HPCs. Analysis of hits in brain extracts from 11 AD, 7 HPCs and 9 controls revealed a similar fold difference in these six miRNAs, with three showing statistically significant group differences and one with a strong trend toward group differences. Thereafter, we focused on the four miRNAs that showed group differences and measured their content in neurally derived blood EVs isolated from 63 subjects: 16 patients with early stage dementia and a CSF Aβ42+ tau profile consistent with AD, 16 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and an AD CSF profile, and 31 cognitively intact controls with normal CSF Aβ42+ tau levels. ROC analysis indicated that measurement of miR-132-3p in neurally-derived plasma EVs showed good sensitivity and specificity to diagnose AD, but did not effectively separate individuals with AD-MCI from controls. Moreover, when we measured the levels of a related miRNA, miR-212, we found that this miRNA was also decreased in neural EVs from AD patients compared to controls. Our results suggest that measurement of miR-132 and miR-212 in neural EVs should be further investigated as a diagnostic aid for AD and as a potential theragnostic.",11/07/2005,1208,Front Neurosci,PubMed,PMID: 31849573 PMCID: PMC6902042,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31849573,mild cognitive impairment; blood biomarker; extracellular vesicles; L1CAM; micro-RNA; qRT-PCR,

Scientists have discovered that the causes of AD may include a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors, but the exact cause has not yet been elucidated. Effective strategies to prevent and treat AD therefore remain elusive. The identified genetic causes of AD mainly focus on individual genes, but growing evidence has shown that complex diseases are usually affected by the interaction of genes in a network. Few studies have focused on the interactions and correlations between genes and how they are gradually destroyed or disappear during AD progression. A differential network analysis has been recognized as an essential tool for identifying the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and significant genes for prediction analysis. We therefore aim to conduct a differential network analysis to reveal potential networks involved in the neuropathogenesis of AD and identify genes for AD prediction. Methods: In this paper, we selected 365 samples from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, including 193 clinically and neuropathologically confirmed AD subjects and 172 no cognitive impairment (NCI) controls. Then, we selected 158 genes belonging to the AD pathway (hsa05010) of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. We employed a machine learning method, namely, joint density-based non-parametric differential interaction network analysis and classification (JDINAC), in the analysis of gene expression data (RNA-seq data). We searched for the differential networks in the RNA-seq data with a pathological diagnosis of AD. Finally, an optimal prediction model was built through cross-validation, which showed good discrimination and calibration for AD prediction. Results: We used JDINAC to derive a gene co-expression network and to explore the relationship between the interaction of gene pairs and AD, and the top 10 differential gene pairs were identified. We then compared the prediction performance between JDINAC and individual genes based on prediction methods. JDINAC provides better accuracy of classification than the latest methods, such as random forest and penalized logistic regression. Conclusions: The interaction between gene pairs is related to AD and can provide more insight than the individual genes in AD prediction.",11/07/2005,1162,Front Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 31736866 PMCID: PMC6834789,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31736866,Alzheimer's disease; gene expression; neurodegenerative disease; machine learning; differential networks,

We examined the risk of Alzheimer's dementia attributable to pathologic AD and 8 other neuropathologies. METHODS: Participants (n = 1,161) came from 2 clinical-pathological studies of aging. Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations of 8 neuropathological indices with Alzheimer's dementia and quantified the percentage of cases attributable to each. Furthermore, because some dementia cases are not driven by common neuropathologies, we re-estimated the attributable risks after empirically adjusting for such cases. RESULTS: Of 1,161 persons, 512 (44.1%) had Alzheimer's dementia at time of death. With the exception of microinfarcts, all neuropathological indices were independently associated with greater odds of Alzheimer's dementia. Two hundred ten (41.0%) Alzheimer's dementia cases were attributable to pathological AD. Separately, 8.9% were attributable to macroscopic infarcts, 10.8% to Lewy bodies, 5.2% to hippocampal sclerosis, 11.7% to transactive response DNA-binding protein 43, 8.1% to cerebral amyloid angiopathy, 6.0% to atherosclerosis, and 5.2% to arteriolosclerosis. A total of 83.3% of cases were attributable to all 8 indices combined. However, after further adjustment for cases driven by other factors, a total of 67.5% of cases were attributable to all 8 neuropathologic indices combined. INTERPRETATION: Pathological AD accounts for a considerable percentage of Alzheimer's dementia cases, but multiple other neuropathologies also contribute. In total, just over two-thirds of Alzheimer's dementia cases are attributable to common age-related neuropathologies, suggesting that other disease and resilience factors are important.

Here, we evaluated the utility of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and astrocytes as tools to systematically test AD-relevant cellular phenotypes following perturbation of candidate genes identified by genome-wide studies. Lentiviral-mediated delivery of shRNAs was used to modulate expression of 66 genes in astrocytes and 52 genes in induced neurons. Five genes (CNN2, GBA, GSTP1, MINT2 and FERMT2) in neurons and nine genes (CNN2, ITGB1, MINT2, SORL1, VLDLR, NPC1, NPC2, PSAP and SCARB2) in astrocytes significantly altered extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) levels. Knockdown of AP3M2, CNN2, GSTP1, NPC1, NPC2, PSAP and SORL1 reduced interleukin-6 levels in astrocytes. Only knockdown of FERMT2 led to a reduction in the proportion of TAU that is phosphorylated. Further, CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of FERMT2 in both familial AD (fAD) and fAD-corrected human neurons validated the findings of reduced extracellular Aβ. Interestingly, FERMT2 reduction had no effect on the Aβ42:40 ratio in corrected neurons and a reduction of phospho-tau, but resulted in an elevation in Aβ42:40 ratio and no reduction in phospho-tau in fAD neurons.

Bile acids (BAs), products of cholesterol metabolism and clearance, are produced in the liver and are further metabolized by gut bacteria. They have major regulatory and signaling functions and seem dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Serum levels of 15 primary and secondary BAs and their conjugated forms were measured in 1464 subjects including 370 cognitively normal older adults, 284 with early mild cognitive impairment, 505 with late mild cognitive impairment, and 305 AD cases enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed associations of BA profiles including selected ratios with diagnosis, cognition, and AD-related genetic variants, adjusting for confounders and multiple testing. RESULTS: In AD compared to cognitively normal older adults, we observed significantly lower serum concentrations of a primary BA (cholic acid [CA]) and increased levels of the bacterially produced, secondary BA, deoxycholic acid, and its glycine and taurine conjugated forms. An increased ratio of deoxycholic acid:CA, which reflects 7α-dehydroxylation of CA by gut bacteria, strongly associated with cognitive decline, a finding replicated in serum and brain samples in the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project. Several genetic variants in immune response-related genes implicated in AD showed associations with BA profiles. DISCUSSION: We report for the first time an association between altered BA profile, genetic variants implicated in AD, and cognitive changes in disease using a large multicenter study. These findings warrant further investigation of gut dysbiosis and possible role of gut-liver-brain axis in the pathogenesis of AD.",2019-01,76-92,Alzheimers Dement,PubMed,PMID: 30337151 PMCID: PMC6487485,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30337151,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer's disease; Immunity; Liver; Inflammation; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Lipidomics; Metabolomics; Bile Acids and Salts; Metabolome; Atlas for Alzheimer; Dysbiosis; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Genetic variants; Gut microbiome; Gut-liver-brain axis,

The cellular mechanism(s) underlying degeneration of these neurons and the relationship to cognitive performance remains largely undefined. Here, we profiled neurotrophin and neurotrophin receptor gene expression within microdissected CA1 neurons along with regional hippocampal dissections from subjects who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD using laser capture microdissection (LCM), custom-designed microarray analysis, and qPCR of CA1 subregional dissections. Gene expression levels were correlated with cognitive test scores and AD neuropathology criteria. We found a significant downregulation of several neurotrophin genes (e.g., Gdnf, Ngfb, and Ntf4) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in MCI compared to NCI and AD subjects. In addition, the neurotrophin receptor transcripts TrkB and TrkC were decreased in MCI and AD compared to NCI. Regional hippocampal dissections also revealed select neurotrophic gene dysfunction providing evidence for vulnerability within the hippocampus proper during the progression of dementia. Downregulation of several neurotrophins of the NGF family and cognate neurotrophin receptor (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) genes correlated with antemortem cognitive measures including the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), a composite global cognitive score (GCS), and Episodic, Semantic, and Working Memory, Perceptual Speed, and Visuospatial domains. Significant correlations were found between select neurotrophic expression downregulation and neuritic plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), but not diffuse plaques (DPs).

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether the burden of vascular risk factors proximate to death is associated with amyloid-β and tau levels or modified their known association. METHODS: We examined the brains of 1, 585 participants from two longitudinal community-based studies of older adults. Amyloid-β and tau were quantified by postmortem examination. The burden of vascular risk factors was summarized by calculating the Framingham general cardiovascular risk score (FRS) proximate to death. Using linear regressions, we examined the association of the FRS with the amyloid-β and tau levels and examined if the FRS modified the association of the amyloid-β with tau. RESULTS: On average, participants were nearly 90 years old and two-thirds were women. The FRS was not associated with amyloid-β (Spearman r  = -0.00, p  = 0.918) or tau (r = 0.01, p = 0.701). However, the FRS as a whole (estimate = -0.022, SE = 0.008, p = 0.009), and specifically the systolic blood pressure (SBP) component (estimate = -0.033, SE = 0.012, p = 0.009), modified the association of the amyloid-β with tau. Further analysis showed that the association between amyloid-β and tau was stronger at lower levels of SBP. CONCLUSION: Late-life vascular risk scores were not related to postmortem levels of amyloid-β or tau.

Because one of the most common clinical presentations of early stage dementia is memory impairment, we examined the relationship of T2D with memory function, using the recently published scientific literature. RECENT FINDINGS: We conducted a structured review to identify studies of ""T2D and memory"" published since 2015. After review of the 129 articles retrieved, we identified 14 studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among the eight studies with a single assessment of memory function in time (mostly cross-sectional), six found an association of T2D with lower memory function, but mostly in select subgroups of persons. Separately, six studies included repeated measures of memory (longitudinal design). Four out of six longitudinal studies found that T2D was related with a faster decline in memory, while two did not. Among the four studies showing a relation with memory decline, two had sample sizes of 9000-10,000 persons. Further, three longitudinal studies controlled for hypertension and stroke as covariates, and results suggested that common vascular risk factors and diseases do not account for the relation. While mechanistic studies clearly support a role for cerebrovascular disease in the relation of T2D with cognition, emerging data suggest that insulin resistance in the brain itself may also play a role. Most, but not all, recently published studies suggest that T2D is associated with a lower level and faster decline in memory function. This association does not appear to be fully accounted for by common vascular processes.

Due to the computational burden, existing TWAS methods do not assess distant trans-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) that are known to explain important expression variation for most genes. We propose a Bayesian genome-wide TWAS (BGW-TWAS) method that leverages both cis- and trans-eQTL information for a TWAS. Our BGW-TWAS method is based on Bayesian variable selection regression, which not only accounts for cis- and trans-eQTL of the target gene but also enables efficient computation by using summary statistics from standard eQTL analyses. Our simulation studies illustrated that BGW-TWASs achieved higher power compared to existing TWAS methods that do not assess trans-eQTL information. We further applied BWG-TWAS to individual-level GWAS data (N = ∼3.3K), which identified significant associations between the genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) of ZC3H12B and Alzheimer dementia (AD) (p value = 5.42 × 10-13), neurofibrillary tangle density (p value = 1.89 × 10-6), and global measure of AD pathology (p value = 9.59 × 10-7).

We find an association between Dlgap2 and AD phenotypes at the variant, gene and protein expression, and methylation levels. Lower cortical DLGAP2 expression is observed in AD and is associated with more plaques and tangles at autopsy and faster cognitive decline. Results will inform future studies aimed at investigating the cross-species role of Dlgap2 in regulating cognitive decline and highlight the benefit of using genetically diverse mice to prioritize novel candidates.",01/09/2020,108091,Cell Rep,PubMed,PMID: 32877673 PMCID: PMC7502175,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32877673,Alzheimer’s; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Age Factors; Species Specificity; Genome-Wide Association Study; aging; Alzheimer Disease; Dementia; cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; GWAS; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Black or African American; resilience; Diversity Outbred; Dlgap2; genetic diversity; spines; susceptibility; translational,

However, the relationship of EPVS with age-related neuropathologies is not well understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the neuropathologic correlates of EPVS in a large community-based cohort of older adults. The cognitive correlates of EPVS over and beyond those of other pathologies were also assessed. METHODS: This study included 654 older deceased and autopsied participants of 3 longitudinal community-based studies of aging that had available data on cognition, ex vivo brain magnetic resonance imaging, and detailed neuropathologic examination. EPVS seen on ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging were histologically validated. Experienced observers rated EPVS burden in ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging using a semiquantitative 4-level scale. Elastic-net regularized ordinal logistic regression was used to investigate associations of EPVS burden with age-related neuropathologies. Mixed-effects models of cognition controlling for neuropathologies, demographics, and clinical factors, were used to determine whether EPVS burden has additional contributions to cognitive decline. RESULTS: EPVS burden in the whole group was associated with gross infarcts (odds ratio=1.67, P=0.0017) and diabetes mellitus (odds ratio=1.73, P=0.004). When considering only nondemented participants (with mild or no cognitive impairment), EPVS burden was associated with gross infarcts (odds ratio=1.74, P=0.016) and microscopic infarcts (odds ratio=1.79, P=0.013). EPVS burden was associated with faster decline in visuospatial abilities (estimate=-0.009, P=0.028), in the whole group, as well as lower levels of semantic memory (estimate=-0.13, P=0.048) and visuospatial abilities (estimate=-0.11, P=0.016) at the time of death. CONCLUSIONS: EPVS and infarcts may share similar neurobiological pathways regardless of dementia status. EPVS burden is linked to diabetes mellitus independently of neuropathologies, extending recent findings in animal studies implicating diabetes mellitus in impairment of the glymphatic system. Finally, EPVS burden may reflect additional brain tissue injury that may contribute to cognitive decline, not captured with traditional neuropathologic measures.",2020-09,2825-2833,Stroke,PubMed,PMID: 32757750 PMCID: PMC7484322,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32757750,"Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Brain; aging; Nervous System Diseases; cognition; Longitudinal Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; neuropathology; Aging; Memory; Neurologic Examination; Neuropsychological Tests; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Independent Living; Psychomotor Performance; Cerebral Infarction; Diabetes Complications; magnetic resonance imaging",

METHODS: This clinical-pathologic study was derived from a community-based cohort study, the Religious Orders Study. We studied 150 individuals (mean age at death =87 years, 48% women): 75 with and 75 without diabetes (matched by sex on age at death and education). Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and ex vivo stimulation of brain tissue with insulin, we assessed insulin signaling in the postmortem middle frontal gyrus cortex. Postmortem data documented AD neuropathology. Clinical evaluations documented cognitive function proximate to death, based on 17 neuropsychological tests. In adjusted regression analyses, we examined associations of brain insulin signaling with diabetes, AD, and level of cognition. RESULTS: Brain insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) phosphorylation (pS307 IRS1/total IRS1) and serine/threonine-protein kinase (AKT) phosphorylation (pT308 AKT1/total AKT1) were similar in persons with or without diabetes. AKT phosphorylation was associated with the global AD pathology score (p = 0.001). In contrast, IRS1 phosphorylation was not associated with AD (p = 0.536). No other associations of insulin signaling were found with the global AD score, including when using the ex vivo brain insulin stimulation method. In secondary analyses, normalized pT308 AKT1 was positively correlated with both the amyloid burden and tau tangle density, and no other associations of brain insulin signaling with neuropathology were observed. Moreover, normalized pT308 AKT1 was associated with a lower level of global cognitive function (estimate = -0.212, standard error = 0.097; p = 0.031). INTERPRETATION: Brain AKT phosphorylation, a critical node in the signaling of insulin and other growth factors, is associated with AD neuropathology and lower cognitive function.

In aging and preclinical AD, men also show more cognitive deficits. Here, we show that the X chromosome affects AD-related vulnerability in mice expressing the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP), a model of AD. XY-hAPP mice genetically modified to develop testicles or ovaries showed worse mortality and deficits than did XX-hAPP mice with either gonad, indicating a sex chromosome effect. To dissect whether the absence of a second X chromosome or the presence of a Y chromosome conferred a disadvantage on male mice, we varied sex chromosome dosage. With or without a Y chromosome, hAPP mice with one X chromosome showed worse mortality and deficits than did those with two X chromosomes. Thus, adding a second X chromosome conferred resilience to XY males and XO females. In addition, the Y chromosome, its sex-determining region Y gene (Sry), or testicular development modified mortality in hAPP mice with one X chromosome such that XY males with testicles survived longer than did XY or XO females with ovaries. Furthermore, a second X chromosome conferred resilience potentially through the candidate gene Kdm6a, which does not undergo X-linked inactivation. In humans, genetic variation in KDM6A was linked to higher brain expression and associated with less cognitive decline in aging and preclinical AD, suggesting its relevance to human brain health.

We conducted a set of experimental cell culture studies of gene regulation by micro RNAs (miRNAs), based on genome-wide transcriptome, proteome, and miRNA expression data from twenty postmortem samples of lateral amygdala from donors with known neuroticism scores. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and TargetScan, we identified a list of mRNA-protein-miRNA sets whose expression patterns were consistent with miRNA-based translational repression, as a function of trait anxiety. Here, we focused on one gene from that list, which is of particular translational significance in Psychiatry: synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) is the binding site of the anticonvulsant drug levetiracetam ((S)-α-Ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidineacetamide), which has shown promise in anxiety disorder treatments. We confirmed that SV2A is associated with neuroticism or anxiety using an original GWAS of a community cohort (N = 1,706), and cross-referencing a published GWAS of multiple cohorts (Ns ranging from 340,569 to 390,278). Postmortem amygdala expression profiling implicated three putative regulatory miRNAs to target SV2A: miR-133a, miR-138, and miR-218. Moving from association to experimental causal testing in cell culture, we used a luciferase assay to demonstrate that miR-133a and miR-218, but not miR-138, significantly decreased relative luciferase activity from the SV2A dual-luciferase construct. In human neuroblastoma cells, transfection with miR-133a and miR-218 reduced both endogenous SV2A mRNA and protein levels, confirming miRNA targeting of the SV2A gene. This study illustrates the utility of combining postmortem gene expression data with GWAS to guide experimental cell culture assays examining gene regulatory mechanisms that may contribute to complex human traits.

In this study, we performed metabolite profiling in both brain (n = 109) and matching serum samples (n = 566) to identify differentially expressed metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with neuropathology and cognitive performance and to identify individuals at high risk of developing cognitive impairment. The abundances of 6 metabolites, glycolithocholate (GLCA), petroselinic acid, linoleic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid and the deoxycholate/cholate (DCA/CA) ratio, along with the dysregulation scores of 3 metabolic pathways, primary bile acid biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids showed significant differences across both brain and serum diagnostic groups (P-value < 0.05). Significant associations were observed between the levels of differential metabolites/pathways and cognitive performance, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuritic plaque burden. Metabolites abundances and personalized metabolic pathways scores were used to derive machine learning models, respectively, that could be used to differentiate cognitively impaired persons from those without cognitive impairment (median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.772 for the metabolite level model; median AUC = 0.731 for the pathway level model).

METHODS: Data came from 1,356 community-based older persons who completed detailed annual cognitive testing and systematic neuropathologic examination at autopsy to identify LATE-NC, ADNC, and other age-related pathologies. Persons were categorized into (0) a group without a pathologic diagnosis of LATE or ADNC (n = 378), (1) LATE-NC without ADNC (n = 91), (2) ADNC without LATE-NC (n = 535), and (3) mixed ADNC with LATE-NC (n = 352).

RESULTS: Compared to those without LATE-NC or ADNC, those with pure LATE-NC had a faster decline in global cognition (p = 0.025) and episodic memory (p = 0.002); however, compared to persons with pure ADNC, those with pure LATE-NC showed a slower decline.

Yet, little is known about the genetic factors that allow these potentially resilient individuals to remain cognitively unimpaired in the face of substantial neuropathology. We performed a large, genome-wide association study (GWAS) of two previously validated metrics of cognitive resilience quantified using a latent variable modelling approach and representing better-than-predicted cognitive performance for a given level of neuropathology. Data were harmonized across 5108 participants from a clinical trial of Alzheimer's disease and three longitudinal cohort studies of cognitive ageing. All analyses were run across all participants and repeated restricting the sample to individuals with unimpaired cognition to identify variants at the earliest stages of disease. As expected, all resilience metrics were genetically correlated with cognitive performance and education attainment traits (P-values < 2.5 × 10-20), and we observed novel correlations with neuropsychiatric conditions (P-values < 7.9 × 10-4). Notably, neither resilience metric was genetically correlated with clinical Alzheimer's disease (P-values > 0.42) nor associated with APOE (P-values > 0.13). In single variant analyses, we observed a genome-wide significant locus among participants with unimpaired cognition on chromosome 18 upstream of ATP8B1 (index single nucleotide polymorphism rs2571244, minor allele frequency = 0.08, P = 2.3 × 10-8). The top variant at this locus (rs2571244) was significantly associated with methylation in prefrontal cortex tissue at multiple CpG sites, including one just upstream of ATPB81 (cg19596477; P = 2 × 10-13). Overall, this comprehensive genetic analysis of resilience implicates a putative role of vascular risk, metabolism, and mental health in protection from the cognitive consequences of neuropathology, while also providing evidence for a novel resilience gene along the bile acid metabolism pathway.

Identified disease-associated variants were further assessed in an independent cohort of CHs, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data, brain autopsy data, and functional experiments. RESULTS: Rare synonymous variants in 4 genes (CDH23, SLC9A3R1, RHBDD2, and ITIH2) segregated with AD status in multiplex families and had a significantly higher frequency in these families compared with reference populations of similar ancestry. In comparison to subjects without dementia, expression of CDH23 (β = 0.53, p = 0.006) and SLC9A3R1 (β = 0.50, p = 0.02) was increased, and expression of RHBDD2 (β = -0.70, p = 0.02) decreased in individuals with AD at death. In line with this finding, increased expression of CDH23 (β = 0.26 ± 0.08, p = 4.9E-4) and decreased expression of RHBDD2 (β = -0.60 ± 0.12, p = 5.5E-7) were related to brain amyloid load (p = 0.0025).

We also conducted an EWAS of MDD in each sex separately. RESULTS: We found epigenome-wide significant associations between brain tissue-based DNA methylation and late-life MDD. The most significant and robust association was found with altered methylation levels in the YOD1 locus (cg25594636, p value = 2.55 × 10-11; cg03899372, p value = 3.12 × 10-09; cg12796440, p value = 1.51 × 10-08, cg23982678, p value = 7.94 × 10-08). Analysis of differentially methylated regions (p value = 5.06 × 10-10) further confirmed this locus. Other significant loci include UGT8 (cg18921206, p value = 1.75 × 10-08), FNDC3B (cg20367479, p value = 4.97 × 10-08) and SLIT2 (cg10946669, p value = 8.01 × 10-08). Notably, brain tissue-based methylation levels were strongly associated with late-life MDD in men more than in women. CONCLUSIONS: We identified altered methylation in the YOD1, UGT8, FNDC3B, and SLIT2 loci as new epigenetic factors associated with late-life MDD. Furthermore, our study highlights the sex-specific molecular heterogeneity of MDD.",30/07/2020,262,Transl Psychiatry,PubMed,PMID: 32733030 PMCID: PMC7393126,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32733030,"Female; Humans; Male; Genome-Wide Association Study; Brain; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenome; Depression; Depressive Disorder, Major",

We first performed sex-stratified genome-wide associations, and then applied derived sex-dependent weights to two independent cohorts. Relative to sex-mismatched scores, sex-matched polygenic hazard scores showed significantly stronger associations with age-at-disease-onset, clinical progression, amyloid deposition, neurofibrillary tangles, and composite neuropathological scores, independent of apolipoprotein E. Models without using hazard weights, i.e. polygenic risk scores, showed lower predictive power than polygenic hazard scores with no evidence for sex differences.

RESULTS: Sunlight and PA conjointly increased serum vitamin D. Changes in vitamin D levels partially mediated how sunlight and PA impacted adiposity in visceral and subcutaneous regions within a subjective PA model. In an objective PA model, vitamin D was a mediator for subcutaneous regions only.

RESULTS: In a functional mixed effects model, postmortem markers (Alzheimer disease pathology, Lewy bodies, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 pathology, hippocampal sclerosis, atherosclerosis, gross infarcts) were associated with global cognitive decline. Residual global cognitive decline after adjustment for neuropathologic burden was weakly related to age at death; it occurred in only about one-third of participants, mostly proximate to death. Results were comparable after eliminating the initial cognitive assessments to minimize retest learning or controlling for frailty proximate to death. Analyses were also conducted with composite measures of episodic memory and perceptual speed. Residual decline not attributable to neuropathologic burden was confined to a subset for each outcome and was most evident proximate to death. Age at death was unrelated to residual decline in episodic memory but was related to residual decline in perceptual speed. INTERPRETATION: Late life cognitive loss mainly reflects non-normative pathologic and mortality-related processes rather than normative age-related processes.

Similarly to CAA, our in vitro BBB displayed significantly more amyloid accumulation in APOE4 compared to APOE3. Combinatorial experiments revealed that dysregulation of calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling and APOE in pericyte-like mural cells induces APOE4-associated CAA pathology. In the human brain, APOE and NFAT are selectively dysregulated in pericytes of APOE4 carriers, and inhibition of calcineurin-NFAT signaling reduces APOE4-associated CAA pathology in vitro and in vivo.

The objectives of this study were to determine the association between the FMR1 gene gray zone expansions, AGG interspersions, and the presence of parkinsonism and motor and cognitive function in an elderly community-based population. METHODS: Automated FMR1 polymerase chain reaction was performed on existing samples from 2 longitudinal aging studies whose subjects agreed to brain donation. A detailed clinical evaluation including a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score, a composite score of global motor function, 17 cognitive tests summarized as a global measure of cognition, and neuropathological examination were obtained for genotyped participants. RESULTS: The average age of the population (n = 2362) was 85.9 ± 7.3 years, and average age at death was 88.6 ± 6.4 years (n = 1326), with 72% women. The prevalence of FMR1 gray zone alleles was 5.2% (122 of 2362). There was no difference between participants with gray zone expansions or those lacking AGG interspersions compared with normal participants in global cognition, global motor function, clinical diagnosis, or pathological changes. Gray zone alleles were associated with signs of parkinsonism in men (P = 0.01), and gray zone carrier men were more likely to die (hazard ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.31-4.16). CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest study to investigate gray zone alleles in a community population. The key findings are that in men, the gray zone allele is associated with signs of parkinsonism and higher risk of death, but not with intranuclear neuronal inclusions. © 2020 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.",2020-08,1448-1456,Mov Disord,PubMed,PMID: 32463542 PMCID: PMC10335806,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32463542,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Alleles; Parkinsonian Disorders; atypical parkinsonism; fragile X; Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein; Fragile X Syndrome; FXTAS; Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion",

An important aim of these studies is the identification of candidate genes that demonstrate congruent disease-related alterations across the different data types measured by the study. We developed a new method to detect such candidate genes in large multi-omic case-control studies that measure multiple data types in the same set of samples. The method is based on a gene-centric integrative coefficient quantifying to what degree consistent differences are observed in the different data types. For statistical inference, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used to study the distribution of the integrative coefficient. The model employs a conditional autoregressive prior to integrate a functional gene network and to share information between genes known to be functionally related. We applied the method to an AD dataset consisting of histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and RNA transcription data from human cortical tissue samples of 233 subjects, and we detected 816 genes with consistent differences between persons with AD and controls. The findings were validated in protein data and in RNA transcription data from two independent AD studies. Finally, we found three subnetworks of jointly dysregulated genes within the functional gene network which capture three distinct biological processes: myeloid cell differentiation, protein phosphorylation and synaptic signaling. Further investigation of the myeloid network indicated an upregulation of this network in early stages of AD prior to accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and suggested that increased CSF1 transcription in astrocytes may contribute to microglial activation in AD. Thus, we developed a method that integrates multiple data types and external knowledge of gene function to detect candidate genes, applied the method to an AD dataset, and identified several disease-related genes and processes demonstrating the usefulness of the integrative approach.",2020-04,e1007771,PLoS Comput Biol,PubMed,PMID: 32255787 PMCID: PMC7138305,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32255787,"Humans; Case-Control Studies; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Transcriptome; Alzheimer Disease; Algorithms; Epigenomics; Bayes Theorem; Cell Differentiation",

This incertitude can be solved by factor analysis, provided that the analysis includes a broad range of cognitive tests that have been administered to a very large number of people. In this article, two such factor analyses were performed, each combining multiple studies. However, because it was not possible to obtain complete multivariate data on more than the most common test variables in the field, not all possible domains were examined here. The first analysis was a factor meta-analysis of correlation matrices combining data of 60,398 healthy participants from 52 studies. Several models from the literature were fitted, of which a version based on the Cattell-Horn-Carroll (CHC) model was found to describe the correlations better than the others.

A loss of BMC function is suspected to play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). METHODS: BMC markers, namely smooth muscle alpha actin (α-SMA) for smooth muscle cells, as well as platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ) and aminopeptidase N (ANPEP or CD13) for pericytes, were assessed by Western immunoblotting in microvessel extracts from the parietal cortex of 60 participants of the Religious Orders study, with ages at death ranging from 75 to 98 years old. RESULTS: Participants clinically diagnosed with AD had lower vascular levels of α-SMA, PDGFRβ and CD13. These reductions were correlated with lower cognitive scores for global cognition, episodic and semantic memory, perceptual speed and visuospatial ability. In addition, α-SMA, PDGFRβ and CD13 were negatively correlated with vascular Aβ40 concentrations. Vascular levels of BMC markers were also inversely correlated with insoluble cleaved phosphorylated transactive response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43) (25 kDa) and positively correlated with soluble cleaved phosphorylated TDP-43 (35 kDa) in cortical homogenates, suggesting strong association between BMC loss and cleaved phosphorylated TDP-43 aggregation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight a loss of BMC in AD.

METHODS: The Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project are clinicopathologic cohort studies of aging. The current study included 547 participants who had undergone brain autopsy and postmortem hippocampal volume measurement by November 1, 2018. Hippocampal volume was measured with postmortem MRI via a 3D region of interest applied to the hippocampal formation. Neuropathologies were measured via uniform structured evaluations. Linear regression analyses estimated the proportion of variance of hippocampal volume attributable to AD and non-AD neuropathologies. RESULTS: The average age at death was 90 years, and the average hippocampal volume was 2.1 mL. AD, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP), hippocampal sclerosis (HS), and atherosclerosis were associated with hippocampal volume. After demographics and total hemisphere volume were controlled for, 7.0% of the variance (95% bootstrapped confidence interval [CI] 4.3%-10.5%) of hippocampal volume was attributable to AD pathology.

Although there are robust protective effects for higher levels of conscientiousness, results are mixed for other personality traits. In particular, higher levels of neuroticism have significantly predicted an increased risk of mortality, no-risk at all, and even a reduced risk of dying. The current study hypothesizes that one potential reason for the discrepancy in these findings for neuroticism is that interactions among neuroticism and other key personality traits have largely been ignored. Thus, in the current study we focus on testing whether the personality traits neuroticism and conscientiousness interact to predict mortality. Specifically, we borrow from recent evidence of ""healthy neuroticism"" to explore whether higher levels of neuroticism are only a risk factor for increased mortality risk when conscientiousness levels are low. We conducted a pre-registered integrative data analysis using 12 different cohort studies (total N = 44,702). Although a consistent pattern emerged of higher levels of conscientiousness predicting a reduced hazard of dying, neuroticism did not show a consistent pattern of prediction. Moreover, no study provided statistical evidence of a neuroticism by conscientiousness interaction. The current findings do not support the idea that the combination of high conscientiousness and high neuroticism can be protective for longevity. Future work is needed to explore different protective factors that may buffer the negative effects of higher levels of neuroticism on health, as well as other behaviors and outcomes that may support the construct of healthy neuroticism.",12/07/2005,33,Collabra Psychol,PubMed,PMID: 33354648 PMCID: PMC7751763,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33354648,mortality; Big Five; conscientiousness; coordinated IDA; healthy neuroticism; IALSA,

However, recent research has identified circumstances under which neuroticism is associated with positive outcomes. The current project examined whether ""healthy neuroticism"", defined as the interaction of neuroticism and conscientiousness, was associated with the following health behaviors: smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Using a pre-registered multi-study coordinated integrative data analysis (IDA) approach, we investigated whether ""healthy neuroticism"" predicted the odds of engaging in each of the aforementioned activities. Each study estimated identical models, using the same covariates and data transformations, enabling optimal comparability of results. These results were then meta-analyzed in order to estimate an average (N-weighted) effect and to ascertain the extent of heterogeneity in the effects. Overall, these results suggest that neuroticism alone was not related to health behaviors, while individuals higher in conscientiousness were less likely to be smokers or drinkers, and more likely to engage in physical activity. In terms of the healthy neuroticism interaction of neuroticism and conscientiousness, significant interactions for smoking and physical activity suggest that the association between neuroticism and health behaviors was smaller among those high in conscientiousness.

It is particularly important to establish biomarkers of brain aging to better understand neurodegenerative diseases. To advance application of epigenetic clocks-which were largely created with DNA methylation levels in blood samples-for use in brain, we need clearer evaluation of epigenetic clock behavior in brain, including direct comparisons of brain specimens with blood, a more accessible tissue for research. We leveraged data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project to examine three established epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge clocks) and a newer clock, trained in cortical tissue. We calculated each clock in three different specimens: (1) antemortem CD4+ cells derived from blood (n = 41); (2) postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, n = 730); and (3) postmortem posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, n = 186), among older women and men, age 66-108 years at death. Across all clocks, epigenetic age calculated from blood and brain specimens was generally lower than chronologic age, although differences were smallest for the Cortical clock when calculated in the brain specimens. Nonetheless, we found that Pearson correlations of epigenetic to chronologic ages in brain specimens were generally reasonable for all clocks; correlations for the Horvath, Hannum, and PhenoAge clocks largely ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 (all p < 0.0001). The Cortical clock outperformed the other clocks, reaching a correlation of 0.83 in the DLFPC (p < 0.0001) for epigenetic vs. chronologic age. Nonetheless, epigenetic age was quite modestly correlated across blood and DLPFC in 41 participants with paired samples [Pearson r from 0.21 (p = 0.2) to 0.32 (p = 0.05)], indicating that broader research in neurodegeneration may benefit from clocks using CpG sites better conserved across blood and brain. Finally, in analyses stratified by sex, by pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, and by clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia, correlations of epigenetic to chronologic age remained consistently high across all groups. Future research in brain aging will benefit from epigenetic clocks constructed in brain specimens, including exploration of any advantages of focusing on CpG sites conserved across brain and other tissue types.",12/07/2005,555307,Front Neurosci,PubMed,PMID: 33488342 PMCID: PMC7817909,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33488342,aging; dementia; biomarkers; epigenetics; neurology,

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this work was to elucidate the neuropathologic correlates of WMH in a large community-based cohort of older adults. METHODS: Cerebral hemispheres from 603 community-based older adults were imaged with MRI ex vivo. All participants underwent annual clinical evaluation, cognitive assessment, and neuropathologic examination. WMH burden was assessed using a modified Fazekas rating scale. Multiple ordinal logistic regression was used to test the association of WMH burden with an array of age-related neuropathologies, adjusting for demographics. Mixed effects models of cognition controlling for neuropathologies and demographics were used to determine whether WMH burden contributes to cognitive decline beyond measured pathologies. RESULTS: WMH burden in the whole group was associated with both vascular and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathologies: arteriolosclerosis (p < 10-4), gross (p < 10-4), and microscopic infarcts (p = 0.04), and amyloid-β plaques (p = 0.028). In non-demented participants (mild or no cognitive impairment) (N = 332), WMH burden was related to gross infarcts (p = 10-4) and arteriolosclerosis (p < 10-4), but not to AD pathology. Similarly, in those with no cognitive impairment (N = 178), WMH burden was related to gross infarcts (p = 8×10-4) and arteriolosclerosis (p = 0.014). WMH burden was associated with faster decline in perceptual speed in both the whole (p = 0.038) and non-demented (p = 0.006) groups.

Greater age-related FI decline increases Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, and recent studies suggest that certain dietary regimens may influence rates of decline. However, it is uncertain how long-term food consumption affects FI among adults with or without familial history of AD (FH) or APOE4 (ɛ4). OBJECTIVE: Observe how the total diet is associated with long-term cognition among mid- to late-life populations at-risk and not-at-risk for AD. METHODS: Among 1,787 mid-to-late-aged adult UK Biobank participants, 10-year FI trajectories were modeled and regressed onto the total diet based on self-reported intake of 49 whole foods from a Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). RESULTS: Daily cheese intake strongly predicted better FIT scores over time (FH-: β= 0.207, p < 0.001; ɛ4-: β= 0.073, p = 0.008; ɛ4+: β= 0.162, p = 0.001). Alcohol of any type daily also appeared beneficial (ɛ4+: β= 0.101, p = 0.022) and red wine was sometimes additionally protective (FH+: β= 0.100, p = 0.014; ɛ4-: β= 0.59, p = 0.039). Consuming lamb weekly was associated with improved outcomes (FH-: β= 0.066, p = 0.008; ɛ4+: β= 0.097, p = 0.044). Among at risk groups, added salt correlated with decreased performance (FH+: β= -0.114, p = 0.004; ɛ4+: β= -0.121, p = 0.009). CONCLUSION: Modifying meal plans may help minimize cognitive decline. We observed that added salt may put at-risk individuals at greater risk, but did not observe similar interactions among FH- and AD- individuals. Observations further suggest in risk status-dependent manners that adding cheese and red wine to the diet daily, and lamb on a weekly basis, may also improve long-term cognitive outcomes.",12/07/2005,1245-1257,J Alzheimers Dis,PubMed,PMID: 33252089 PMCID: PMC7895545,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33252089,"Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; United Kingdom; functional food; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Longitudinal Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; Apolipoprotein E4; Disease Progression; Aging; cognitive decline; APOE4; Medical History Taking; Biological Specimen Banks; Gene-Environment Interaction; Diet; Alcohol Drinking; Cheese; Intelligence; lamb; Mediterranean diet; nutrition policy; preventive medicine; Problem Solving; Red Meat; red wine; salt; Sodium Chloride, Dietary; Wine",

Those who agree, however, are less likely to have completed brain autopsies compared with older non-Latino Whites of higher socioeconomic status. As such, our understanding of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias remains limited in these underrepresented and understudied populations. Here, we examine perceived impediments to completed brain autopsies among diverse older adults who have agreed to brain donation for clinical research. METHODS: Participants (N=22) were older adults (mean age=77 years) who self-identified as African American (n=8), Latino (n=6), or White of lower income (n=8). All participants had previously agreed to brain donation via the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act. Each participant took part in a one-time, semi-structured focus group. Data were analyzed using a Grounded Theory Approach with both Open Coding and Constant Comparative Coding. RESULTS: Perceived impediments to completed brain autopsies varied by group. Older African Americans and older Latinos expressed concern about a lack of follow-through by family members regarding their brain donation wishes. Older Whites of lower income indicated that their own uncertainty surrounding the processes of brain donation and brain autopsy might serve as an impediment.

METHODS: Older persons (n = 1,071) in a longitudinal cohort study without dementia at enrollment underwent annual cognitive assessments (mean 10.6 years, SD 4.6, range 4-24) prior to death. We estimated the onset of terminal acceleration in cognitive decline and rates of decline before and after this point in change point models that allowed calculation of the percent of cognitive loss attributable to terminal decline. Outcomes were composite measures of global and specific cognitive functions. We also estimated dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) incidence before and during the terminal period. RESULTS: A mean of 3.7 years before death (95% credible interval [CI] -3.8 to -3.5), the rate of global cognitive decline accelerated to -0.313 unit per year (95% CI -0.337 to -0.290), a more than 7-fold increase indicative of terminal decline. The mean global cognitive score dropped 0.377 unit (SD 0.516) assuming no terminal decline and 1.192 units (SD 1.080) with terminal decline. As a result, 71% (95% bootstrapped CI 0.70, 0.73) of overall global cognitive loss was terminal. In subsequent analyses, terminal decline accounted for 70% of episodic memory loss, 65% of semantic memory loss, 57% of working memory loss, 52% of perceptual speed loss, and 53% of visuospatial loss.

It is also unclear whether the metabolic changes in the peripheral blood and brain are overlapping in relation to AD. The present study addresses these questions by targeted metabolomics in both antemortem blood and postmortem brain samples in 2 community-based longitudinal cohorts of aging and dementia. We found that higher serum levels of 3 acylcarnitines, including decanoylcarnitine (C10), pimelylcarnitine (C7-DC), and tetradecadienylcarnitine (C14:2), significantly predict a lower risk of incident AD (composite hazard ratio = 0.368, 95% CI [0.207, 0.653]) after an average of 4.5-year follow-up, independent of age, sex, and education. In addition, baseline serum levels of ten glycerophospholipids, one amino acid, and 5 acylcarnitines predict the longitudinal change in cognitive functions. Moreover, 28 brain metabolites were associated with AD phenotypes. Of the putative metabolites identified in the serum and brain, 4 metabolites (3 glycerophospholipids [PC aa C30:0, PC ae C34:0, PC ae C36:1] and 1 acylcarnitine [C14:2]) were present in both the postmortem brain and antemortem blood, but only one metabolite (C14:2) was associated with AD in the same direction (i.e., protective). Partial correlation and network analyses suggest a potential tissue-specific regulation of metabolism, although other alternatives exist.

However, neuropathologic changes often precede cognitive symptoms by many years and may affect personality itself. Therefore, it is unclear whether supposed dementia-prone personality profiles (high neuroticism and low conscientiousness) are true risk factors or merely reflections of preexisting disease. OBJECTIVES: To examine whether personality during adolescence-a time when preclinical dementia pathology is unlikely to be present-confers risk of dementia in later life and to test whether associations could be accounted for by health factors in adolescence or differed across socioeconomic status (SES). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cohort study in the United States. Participants were members of Project Talent, a national sample of high school students in 1960. Individuals were identified who received a dementia-associated International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code during any year between 2011 and 2013. The dates of our analysis were March 2018 to May 2019. EXPOSURES: Ten personality traits were measured by the 150-item Project Talent Personality Inventory. Socioeconomic status was measured by a composite based on parental educational level, income, occupation, and property ownership. Participants were also surveyed on demographic factors and height and weight. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Medicare records were collected, with dementia diagnoses in the period of 2011 to 2013 classified according to the US Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ICD-9-based algorithm. Cox proportional hazards regression models estimated the relative risk of dementia based on the 10 personality traits, testing interactions with SES and adjusting for demographic confounders. RESULTS: The sample of 82 232 participants was 50.1% female, with a mean (SD) age of 15.8 (1.7) years at baseline and 69.5 (1.2) years at follow-up. Lower risk of dementia was associated with higher levels of vigor (hazard ratio for 1 SD, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.90-0.97; P < .001). Calm and maturity showed protective associations with later dementia that increased with SES. At 1 SD of SES, calm showed a hazard ratio of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.84-0.95; P < .001 for the interaction) and maturity showed a hazard ratio of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85-0.96; P = .001 for the interaction). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study's findings suggest that the adolescent personality traits associated with later-life dementia are similar to those observed in studies of older persons. Moreover, the reduction in dementia risk associated with a calm and mature adolescent phenotype may be greater at higher levels of SES. Personality phenotype may be a true independent risk factor for dementia by age 70 years, preceding it by almost 5 decades and interacting with adolescent socioeconomic conditions.",01/02/2020,148-154,JAMA Psychiatry,PubMed,PMID: 31617877 PMCID: PMC6802373,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617877,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; United States; Adolescent; Risk Factors; Dementia; Personality; Socioeconomic Factors; Personality Inventory; Students,

The HCAP is part of an international research collaboration funded by the National Institute on Aging to better measure and identify cognitive impairment and dementia in representative population-based samples of older adults, in the context of ongoing longitudinal studies of aging in high-, middle-, and low-income countries around the world. METHODS: The HCAP cognitive test battery was designed to measure a range of key cognitive domains affected by cognitive aging (including attention, memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial function) and to allow harmonization and comparisons to other studies in the United States and around the world. The HCAP included a pair of in-person interviews, one with the target HRS respondent (a randomly selected HRS sample member, aged 65+) that lasted approximately 1 h and one with an informant nominated by the respondent that lasted approximately 20 min. The final HRS HCAP sample included 3,496 study subjects, representing a 79% response rate among those invited to participate. CONCLUSION: Linking detailed HCAP cognitive assessments to the wealth of available longitudinal HRS data on cognition, health, biomarkers, genetics, health care utilization, informal care, and economic resources and behavior will provide unique and expanded opportunities to study cognitive impairment and dementia in a nationally representative US population-based sample. The fielding of similar HCAP projects in multiple countries around the world will provide additional opportunities to study international differences in the prevalence, incidence, and outcomes of dementia globally with comparable data.

Lower grey matter volumes, particularly within right medial temporal regions, are associated with higher scam susceptibility; however, very little is known about white matter associates. We investigated associations between white matter integrity measured using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and scam susceptibility in 302 non-demented older adults (75% female; mean years: age = 81.3 + 7.5, education = 15.7 + 2.9). Participants completed comprehensive neuroimaging (including DTI, T1- and T2-weighted imaging), a self-report measure of scam susceptibility, and neuropsychological testing. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) investigated associations of DTI-derived measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), trace of the diffusion tensor, axial and radial diffusivity (separately) with scam susceptibility adjusting for age, sex, education, and white matter hyperintensities (WMH; total volume and voxelwise separately). Statistical significance was determined at p < 0.05, Family Wise Error corrected. TBSS revealed significant negative associations between FA in tracts connecting a number of right hemisphere white matter regions and scam susceptibility, particularly after additional adjustment for global cognitive functioning. The pathways implicated were mainly in right temporal-parietal and temporal-occipital regions. Association of trace, axial, and radial diffusivity with scam susceptibility were not significant in fully-adjusted models. Lower white matter integrity within right hemisphere tracts was associated with higher scam susceptibility independent of relevant confounds including global cognition. Thus, a right hemisphere brain network that includes key structures implicated in multi-sensory processing of immediate and future consequences may serve as a neurobiologic substrate of scam susceptibility in vulnerable older adults.",2020-10,1521-1530,Brain Imaging Behav,PubMed,PMID: 30895444 PMCID: PMC6754317,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30895444,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Brain; Aging; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; White Matter; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Independent Living; White matter; Anisotropy; DTI; Fractional anisotropy; Scam susceptibility",

Personality traits are among the factors that may account for these differences. The current project investigated whether personality traits were associated with trajectories of cognitive decline, and whether the associations were different before and after dementia diagnosis. The data was analyzed using linear mixed effects regression. Across study aims is a focus on replicability and generalizability. Each question was addressed in four independent longitudinal studies (EAS, MAP, ROS, SATSA), then meta-analyzed, providing estimates of replicability. Results indicated that low neuroticism and high openness were associated with total cognitive function.

Yet little is known about its genetic basis. To examine the association of common single nucleotide polymorphisms with cerebral atherosclerosis severity, we conducted a genomewide association study (GWAS) using data collected as part of two community-based cohort studies in the United States, the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). Both studies enroll older individuals and exclude participants with signs of dementia at baseline. From our analysis of 1325 participants of European ancestry who had genotype and neuropathologically assessed cerebral atherosclerosis measures available, we found a novel locus for cerebral atherosclerosis in NTNG1. The locus comprises eight SNPs, including two independent significant SNPs: rs6664221 (β = -0.27, 95% CI = (-0.35, -0.19), p = 1.29 × 10-10) and rs10881463 (β = -0.20, 95% CI = (-0.27, -0.13), p = 3.40 × 10-8). We further found that the SNPs may influence cerebral atherosclerosis by regulating brain protein expression of CNOT3. CNOT3 is a subunit of CCR4-NOT, which has been shown to be a master regulator of mRNA stability and translation and an important complex for cholesterol homeostasis. In summary, we identify a novel genetic locus for cerebral atherosclerosis and a potential mechanism linking this variation to cerebral atherosclerosis progression.

We tested whether dysregulation of cholesterol catabolism, through its conversion to primary bile acids (BAs), was associated with dementia pathogenesis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a 3-step study design to examine the role of the primary BAs, cholic acid (CA), and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as well as their principal biosynthetic precursor, 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7α-OHC), in dementia. In Step 1, we tested whether serum markers of cholesterol catabolism were associated with brain amyloid accumulation, white matter lesions (WMLs), and brain atrophy. In Step 2, we tested whether exposure to bile acid sequestrants (BAS) was associated with risk of dementia. In Step 3, we examined plausible mechanisms underlying these findings by testing whether brain levels of primary BAs and gene expression of their principal receptors are altered in AD. Step 1: We assayed serum concentrations CA, CDCA, and 7α-OHC and used linear regression and mixed effects models to test their associations with brain amyloid accumulation (N = 141), WMLs, and brain atrophy (N = 134) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The BLSA is an ongoing, community-based cohort study that began in 1958. Participants in the BLSA neuroimaging sample were approximately 46% male with a mean age of 76 years; longitudinal analyses included an average of 2.5 follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visits. We used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N = 1,666) to validate longitudinal neuroimaging results in BLSA. ADNI is an ongoing, community-based cohort study that began in 2003. Participants were approximately 55% male with a mean age of 74 years; longitudinal analyses included an average of 5.2 follow-up MRI visits. Lower serum concentrations of 7α-OHC, CA, and CDCA were associated with higher brain amyloid deposition (p = 0.041), faster WML accumulation (p = 0.050), and faster brain atrophy mainly (false discovery rate [FDR] p = <0.001-0.013) in males in BLSA. In ADNI, we found a modest sex-specific effect indicating that lower serum concentrations of CA and CDCA were associated with faster brain atrophy (FDR p = 0.049) in males.Step 2: In the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) dataset, covering >4 million registrants from general practice clinics in the United Kingdom, we tested whether patients using BAS (BAS users; 3,208 with ≥2 prescriptions), which reduce circulating BAs and increase cholesterol catabolism, had altered dementia risk compared to those on non-statin lipid-modifying therapies (LMT users; 23,483 with ≥2 prescriptions). Patients in the study (BAS/LMT) were approximately 34%/38% male and with a mean age of 65/68 years; follow-up time was 4.7/5.7 years. We found that BAS use was not significantly associated with risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72-1.46, p = 0.88) or its subtypes. We found a significant difference between the risk of VaD in males compared to females (p = 0.040) and a significant dose-response relationship between BAS use and risk of VaD (p-trend = 0.045) in males.Step 3: We assayed brain tissue concentrations of CA and CDCA comparing AD and control (CON) samples in the BLSA autopsy cohort (N = 29). Participants in the BLSA autopsy cohort (AD/CON) were approximately 50%/77% male with a mean age of 87/82 years. We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data to compare brain BA receptor gene expression between AD and CON samples from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort (N = 46). ROSMAP is an ongoing, community-based cohort study that began in 1994. Participants (AD/CON) were approximately 56%/36% male with a mean age of 85/85 years. In BLSA, we found that CA and CDCA were detectable in postmortem brain tissue samples and were marginally higher in AD samples compared to CON. In ROSMAP, we found sex-specific differences in altered neuronal gene expression of BA receptors in AD. Study limitations include the small sample sizes in the BLSA cohort and likely inaccuracies in the clinical diagnosis of dementia subtypes in primary care settings. CONCLUSIONS: We combined targeted metabolomics in serum and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI of the brain with pharmacoepidemiologic analysis to implicate dysregulation of cholesterol catabolism in dementia pathogenesis. We observed that lower serum BA concentration mainly in males is associated with neuroimaging markers of dementia, and pharmacological lowering of BA levels may be associated with higher risk of VaD in males. We hypothesize that dysregulation of BA signaling pathways in the brain may represent a plausible biologic mechanism underlying these results. Together, our observations suggest a novel mechanism relating abnormalities in cholesterol catabolism to risk of dementia.",2021-05,e1003615,PLoS Med,PubMed,PMID: 34043628 PMCID: PMC8158920,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34043628,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Gene Expression Profiling; United Kingdom; Dementia; Incidence; Metabolomics; Bile Acids and Salts; Pharmacoepidemiology",

A relationship between LATE-NC and arteriolosclerosis has been reported in some but not all studies. The objectives of this study were to investigate the frequency of co-occurring LATE-NC and microvascular pathologies and test the hypothesis that arteriolosclerosis, specifically, is related to LATE-NC in brains from community-dwelling older persons. Analyses included 749 deceased participants with completed data on LATE-NC and microvascular pathology from 3 longitudinal clinical pathologic studies of aging. Given the specific interest in arteriolosclerosis, we expanded the examination of arteriolosclerosis to include not only the basal ganglia but also two additional white matter regions from anterior and posterior watershed territories. Ordinal logistic regression models examined the association of microvascular pathology with LATE-NC. LATE-NC was present in 409 (54.6%) decedents, of which 354 (86.5%) had one or multiple microvascular pathologies including 132 (32.3%) with moderate-severe arteriolosclerosis in basal ganglia, 195 (47.6%) in anterior watershed, and 144 (35.2%) in posterior watershed; 170 (41.5%) with moderate-severe CAA, and 150 (36.6%) with microinfarcts. In logistic regression models, only posterior watershed arteriolosclerosis, but not other regions of arteriolosclerosis was associated with a higher odds of more advanced LATE-NC stages (Odds Ratio = 1.12; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.01-1.25) after controlling for demographics, AD, and other age-related pathologies. Capillary CAA, but not the severity of CAA was associated with an increased odds of LATE-NC burden (Odds Ratio = 1.71; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.13-2.58).

The molecular mechanisms of Lewy body formation and associated neuronal loss remain largely unknown. To gain insights into proteins and pathways associated with Lewy body pathology, we performed quantitative profiling of the proteome. We analyzed substantia nigra tissue from 51 subjects arranged into three groups: cases with Lewy body pathology, Lewy body-negative controls with matching neuronal loss, and controls with no neuronal loss. Using a label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach, we characterized the proteome both in terms of protein abundances and peptide modifications. Statistical testing for differential abundance of the most abundant 2963 proteins, followed by pathway enrichment and Bayesian learning of the causal network structure, was performed to identify likely drivers of Lewy body formation and dopaminergic neuronal loss. The identified pathways include (1) Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation; (2) synaptic function; (3) poly(A) RNA binding; (4) basement membrane and endothelium; and (5) hydrogen peroxide metabolic process. According to the data, the endothelial/basement membrane pathway is tightly connected with both pathologies and likely to be one of the drivers of neuronal loss.

METHODS: Mouse primary astrocytes, mouse and human brain samples differing by APOE genotypes were collected for measuring cPLA2 expression, phosphorylation, and activity in relation to measures of inflammation and oxidative stress. RESULTS: Greater cPLA2 phosphorylation, cPLA2 activity and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) levels were identified in ApoE4 compared to ApoE3 in primary astrocytes, brains of ApoE-targeted replacement (ApoE-TR) mice, and in human brain homogenates from the inferior frontal cortex of patients with AD carrying APOE3/E4 compared to APOE3/E3. Greater cPLA2 phosphorylation was also observed in human postmortem frontal cortical synaptosomes and primary astrocytes after treatment with recombinant ApoE4 ex vivo. In ApoE4 astrocytes, the greater levels of LTB4, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were reduced after cPLA2 inhibition.

Thus far, these investigations have largely been restricted to bottom-up approaches, hindering the degree to which one can characterize a protein's ""intact"" state. Top-down proteomics (TDP) overcomes this limitation; however, it is typically limited to observing only the most abundant proteoforms and of a relatively small size. Therefore, fractionation techniques are commonly used to reduce sample complexity. Here, we investigate gas-phase fractionation through high-field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) within TDP. Utilizing a high complexity sample derived from Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain tissue, we describe how the addition of FAIMS to TDP can robustly improve the depth of proteome coverage. For example, implementation of FAIMS with external compensation voltage (CV) stepping at -50, -40, and -30 CV could more than double the mean number of non-redundant proteoforms, genes, and proteome sequence coverage compared to without FAIMS. We also found that FAIMS can influence the transmission of proteoforms and their charge envelopes based on their size. Importantly, FAIMS enabled the identification of intact amyloid beta (Aβ) proteoforms, including the aggregation-prone Aβ1-42 variant which is strongly linked to AD.

METHODS: We studied the brains of 1672 older decedents with baseline FRS and measured CVD pathologies including macroinfarcts, microinfarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. We employed a series of logistic regressions to examine the association of baseline FRS with each of the 5 CVD pathologies. RESULTS: Average age at baseline was 80.5±7.0 years and average age at death was 89.2±6.7 years. A higher baseline FRS was associated with higher odds of macroinfarcts (odds ratio, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.07-1.13], P<0.001), microinfarcts (odds ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.07], P=0.009), atherosclerosis (odds ratio, 1.07 [95% CI, 1.04-1.11], P<0.001), and arteriolosclerosis (odds ratio, 1.04 [95% CI, 1.01-1.07], P=0.005). C statistics for these models ranged from 0.537 to 0.595 indicating low accuracy for predicting CVD pathologies. FRS was not associated with the presence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. CONCLUSIONS: A higher FRS score in older adults is associated with higher odds of some, but not all, CVD pathologies, with low discrimination at the individual level. Further work is needed to develop a more robust risk score to identify adults at risk for accumulating CVD pathologies.",2021-06,2060-2067,Stroke,PubMed,PMID: 33840227 PMCID: PMC9069859,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33840227,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Age Factors; Brain; Risk Factors; Autopsy; Intracranial Arteriosclerosis; atherosclerosis; Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy; cerebral amyloid angiopathy; arteriolosclerosis; risk factors; autopsy; cerebral infarction",

Within a test dataset lacking transcriptomic data, traditional two-stage TWAS methods first impute gene expression by creating a weighted sum that aggregates SNPs with their corresponding cis-eQTL effects on reference transcriptome. Traditional TWAS methods then employ a linear regression model to assess the association between imputed gene expression and test phenotype, thereby assuming the effect of a cis-eQTL SNP on test phenotype is a linear function of the eQTL's estimated effect on reference transcriptome. To increase TWAS robustness to this assumption, we propose a novel Variance-Component TWAS procedure (VC-TWAS) that assumes the effects of cis-eQTL SNPs on phenotype are random (with variance proportional to corresponding reference cis-eQTL effects) rather than fixed. VC-TWAS is applicable to both continuous and dichotomous phenotypes, as well as individual-level and summary-level GWAS data. Using simulated data, we show VC-TWAS is more powerful than traditional TWAS methods based on a two-stage Burden test, especially when eQTL genetic effects on test phenotype are no longer a linear function of their eQTL genetic effects on reference transcriptome. We further applied VC-TWAS to both individual-level (N = ~3.4K) and summary-level (N = ~54K) GWAS data to study Alzheimer's dementia (AD). With the individual-level data, we detected 13 significant risk genes including 6 known GWAS risk genes such as TOMM40 that were missed by traditional TWAS methods. With the summary-level data, we detected 57 significant risk genes considering only cis-SNPs and 71 significant genes considering both cis- and trans- SNPs, which also validated our findings with the individual-level GWAS data.

Prior work estimated that the three most studied of these, Alzheimer's disease, infarcts, and Lewy bodies, account for ∼40% of the variation in late life cognitive decline. However, that estimate did not incorporate many other diseases that are now recognized as potent drivers of cognitive decline [e.g. limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE-NC), hippocampal sclerosis, other cerebrovascular conditions]. We examined the degree to which person-specific cognitive decline in old age is driven by a wide array of neuropathologies. Deceased participants (n = 1164) from two longitudinal clinical-pathological studies, the Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study, completed up to 24 annual evaluations including 17 cognitive performance tests and underwent brain autopsy. Neuropathological examinations provided 11 pathological indices, including markers of Alzheimer's disease, non- Alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative diseases (i.e. LATE-NC, hippocampal sclerosis, Lewy bodies), and cerebrovascular conditions (i.e. macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis). Mixed effects models examined the linear relation of pathological indices with global cognitive decline, and random change point models examined the relation of the pathological indices with the onset of terminal decline and rates of preterminal and terminal decline. Cognition declined an average of about 0.10 unit per year (estimate = -0.101, SE = 0.003, P < 0.001) with considerable heterogeneity in rates of decline (variance estimate for the person-specific slope of decline was 0.0094, P < 0.001). When considered separately, 10 of 11 pathological indices were associated with faster decline and accounted for between 2% and 34% of the variation in decline, respectively. When considered simultaneously, the 11 pathological indices together accounted for 43% of the variation in decline; Alzheimer's disease-related indices accounted for 30-36% of the variation, non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative indices 4-10%, and cerebrovascular indices 3-8%. Finally, the 11 pathological indices combined accounted for less than a third of the variation in the onset of terminal decline (28%) and rates of preterminal (32%) and terminal decline (19%). Although age-related neuropathologies account for a large proportion of the variation in late life cognitive decline, considerable variation remains unexplained even after considering a wide array of neuropathologies.

Epistasis has been considered as one of the main causes of ""missing heritability"" in AD. METHODS: We performed genome-wide epistasis screening (N = 10,389) for the clinical diagnosis of AD using three popularly adopted methods. Subsequent analyses were performed to eliminate spurious associations caused by possible confounding factors. Then, candidate genetic interactions were examined for their co-expression in the brains of AD patients and analyzed for their association with intermediate AD phenotypes. Moreover, a new approach was developed to compile the epistasis risk factors into an epistasis risk score (ERS) based on multifactor dimensional reduction. Two independent datasets were used to evaluate the feasibility of ERSs in AD risk prediction. RESULTS: We identified 2 candidate genetic interactions with PFDR <  0.05 (RAMP3-SEMA3A and NSMCE1-DGKE/C17orf67) and another 5 genetic interactions with PFDR <  0.1. Co-expression between the identified interactions supported the existence of possible biological interactions underlying the observed statistical significance. Further association of candidate interactions with intermediate phenotypes helps explain the mechanisms of neuropathological alterations involved in AD. Importantly, we found that ERSs can identify high-risk individuals showing earlier onset of AD. Combined risk scores of SNPs and SNP-SNP interactions showed slightly but steadily increased AUC in predicting the clinical status of AD. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we performed a genome-wide epistasis analysis to identify novel genetic interactions potentially implicated in AD.

The discovery of novel AD-associated genetic variants, particularly in coding regions and from APOE ε4 non-carriers, is critical for understanding the pathology of AD. In this study, we carried out an exome-wide association analysis of age-of-onset of AD with ~20,000 subjects and placed more emphasis on APOE ε4 non-carriers. Using Cox mixed-effects models, we find that age-of-onset shows a stronger genetic signal than AD case-control status, capturing many known variants with stronger significance, and also revealing new variants. We identified two novel variants, rs56201815, a rare synonymous variant in ERN1, and rs12373123, a common missense variant in SPPL2C in the MAPT region in APOE ε4 non-carriers. Besides, a rare missense variant rs144292455 in TACR3 showed the consistent direction of effect sizes across all studies with a suggestive significant level. In an attempt to unravel their regulatory and biological functions, we found that the minor allele of rs56201815 was associated with lower average FDG uptake across five brain regions in ADNI. Our eQTL analyses based on 6198 gene expression samples from ROSMAP and GTEx revealed that the minor allele of rs56201815 was potentially associated with elevated expression of ERN1, a key gene triggering unfolded protein response (UPR), in multiple brain regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex and nucleus accumbens. Our cell-type-specific eQTL analysis using ~80,000 single nuclei in the prefrontal cortex revealed that the protective minor allele of rs12373123 significantly increased the expression of GRN in microglia, and was associated with MAPT expression in astrocytes. These findings provide novel evidence supporting the hypothesis of the potential involvement of the UPR to ER stress in the pathological pathway of AD, and also give more insights into underlying regulatory mechanisms behind the pleiotropic effects of rs12373123 in multiple degenerative diseases including AD and Parkinson's disease.",26/02/2021,146,Transl Psychiatry,PubMed,PMID: 33637690 PMCID: PMC7910483,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33637690,"Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Membrane Proteins; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Endoribonucleases; Exome; Exome Sequencing; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases",

METHODS: This study examined parkinsonism, PD frequency, and cognition of community-dwelling older individuals in 3 longitudinal epidemiologic cohort studies. Parkinsonism was based on an exam utilizing the modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale performed by a nurse. PD was based on self-report, medications used for treatment of PD, and examination findings. Cognition was assessed using 19 performance-based tests that assess 5 cognitive domains. RESULTS: AA participants were less likely to have parkinsonism compared to Whites, even with age and gender differences. Frequency of PD was not significant between groups. AA were more likely to have lower cognitive scores as compared to Whites. AA were less likely to have parkinsonism even with controlling for cognitive differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Parkinsonian signs are present among AA in the community at lower rates than in White individuals.

Cerebral small vessel pathologies are associated with microinfarcts and frequently coexist with Alzheimer disease; however, the extent to which Aβ (amyloid beta) and tau pathology modulates microvascular pathogenesis is not fully understood. Study objective was to examine the relationship of small vessel pathologies, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, with cortical microinfarcts in people with differing levels of Aβ or tau tangle burden. METHODS: Participants were 1489 autopsied older people (mean age at death, 89 years; 67% women) from 1 of 3 ongoing clinical-pathological cohort studies of aging. Neuropathological evaluation identified cortical Aβ and tau tangle burden using immunohistochemistry in 8 brain regions, provided semiquantitative grading of cerebral vessel pathologies, and identified the presence of cortical microinfarcts. Logistic regression models adjusted for demographics and atherosclerosis and examined whether Aβ or tau tangle burden modified relations between small vessel pathologies and cortical microinfarcts. RESULTS: Cortical microinfarcts were present in 17% of older people, moderate-to-severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy pathology in 36%, and arteriolosclerosis in 34%. In logistic regression models, we found interactions with Aβ and tau tangles, reflecting that the association between arteriolosclerosis and cortical microinfarcts was stronger in the context of greater Aβ (estimate, 0.15; SE=0.07; P=0.02) and tau tangle burden (estimate, 0.13; SE=0.06; P=0.02). Interactions also emerged for cerebral amyloid angiopathy, suggesting that the association between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cortical microinfarcts is more robust in the presence of higher Aβ (estimate, 0.27; SE=0.07; P<0.001) and tangle burden (estimate, 0.16; SE=0.06; P=0.005).

The identified pQTLs tend to be non-synonymous variation, are over-represented among variants associated with brain diseases, and replicate well (77%) in an independent brain dataset. Comparison to a large study of brain eQTLs revealed that about 75% of pQTLs are also eQTLs. In contrast, about 40% of eQTLs were identified as pQTLs. These results are consistent with lower pQTL mapping power and greater evolutionary constraint on protein abundance. The latter is additionally supported by observations of pQTLs with large effects' tending to be rare, deleterious, and associated with proteins that have evidence for fewer protein-protein interactions. Mediation analyses using matched transcriptomic and proteomic data provided additional evidence that pQTL effects are often, but not always, mediated by mRNA. Specifically, we identified roughly 1.6 times more mRNA-mediated pQTLs than mRNA-independent pQTLs (550 versus 341).

Clinical,2213-1582,10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102768,"Brain arteriolosclerosis, one of the main pathologies of cerebral small vessel disease, is common in older adults and has been linked to lower cognitive and motor function and higher odds of dementia. In spite of its frequency and associated morbidity, arteriolosclerosis can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to develop an in-vivo classifier of arteriolosclerosis based on brain MRI. First, an ex-vivo classifier of arteriolosclerosis was developed based on features related to white matter hyperintensities, diffusion anisotropy and demographics by applying machine learning to ex-vivo MRI and pathology data from 119 participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Religious Orders Study (ROS), two longitudinal cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented older adults. The ex-vivo classifier showed good performance in predicting the presence of arteriolosclerosis, with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC = 0.78. The ex-vivo classifier was then translated to in-vivo based on available in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI data on the same participants. The in-vivo classifier was named ARTS (short for ARTerioloSclerosis), is fully automated, and provides a score linked to the likelihood a person suffers from arteriolosclerosis. The performance of ARTS in predicting the presence of arteriolosclerosis in-vivo was tested in a separate, 91% dementia-free group of 79 MAP/ROS participants and exhibited an AUC = 0.79 in persons with antemortem intervals shorter than 2.4 years. This level of performance in mostly non-demented older adults is notable considering that arteriolosclerosis can only be diagnosed at autopsy. The scan-rescan reproducibility of the ARTS score was excellent, with an intraclass correlation of 0.99, suggesting that application of ARTS in longitudinal studies may show high sensitivity in detecting small changes. Finally, higher ARTS scores in non-demented older adults were associated with greater decline in cognition two years after baseline MRI, especially in perceptual speed which has been linked to arteriolosclerosis and small vessel disease. This finding was shown in a separate group of 369 non-demented MAP/ROS participants and was validated in 72 non-demented Black participants of the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) and also in 244 non-demented participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 and 3. The results of this work suggest that ARTS may have broad implications in the advancement of diagnosis, prevention and treatment of arteriolosclerosis.

Results: During 7 years of follow-up, 166 of 1,160 (14.3%) developed AD. In a proportional hazards model controlling for age, sex, education, and race, each 1-SD higher baseline global motor score was associated with about a 20% reduction in the risk of AD (hazard ratio: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.97).

Despite this disparity, the largest Alzheimer disease genome-wide association studies to date have been conducted in non-Hispanic White individuals. In the largest association analyses of Alzheimer disease in African American individuals, ABCA7, TREM2, and an intergenic locus at 5q35 were previously implicated. OBJECTIVE: To identify additional risk loci in African American individuals by increasing the sample size and using the African Genome Resource panel. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This genome-wide association meta-analysis used case-control and family-based data sets from the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium. There were multiple recruitment sites throughout the United States that included individuals with Alzheimer disease and controls of African American ancestry. Analysis began October 2018 and ended September 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. RESULTS: A total of 2784 individuals with Alzheimer disease (1944 female [69.8%]) and 5222 controls (3743 female [71.7%]) were analyzed (mean [SD] age at last evaluation, 74.2 [13.6] years). Associations with 4 novel common loci centered near the intracellular glycoprotein trafficking gene EDEM1 (3p26; P = 8.9 × 10-7), near the immune response gene ALCAM (3q13; P = 9.3 × 10-7), within GPC6 (13q31; P = 4.1 × 10-7), a gene critical for recruitment of glutamatergic receptors to the neuronal membrane, and within VRK3 (19q13.33; P = 3.5 × 10-7), a gene involved in glutamate neurotoxicity, were identified. In addition, several loci associated with rare variants, including a genome-wide significant intergenic locus near IGF1R at 15q26 (P = 1.7 × 10-9) and 6 additional loci with suggestive significance (P ≤ 5 × 10-7) such as API5 at 11p12 (P = 8.8 × 10-8) and RBFOX1 at 16p13 (P = 5.4 × 10-7) were identified. Gene expression data from brain tissue demonstrate association of ALCAM, ARAP1, GPC6, and RBFOX1 with brain β-amyloid load. Of 25 known loci associated with Alzheimer disease in non-Hispanic White individuals, only APOE, ABCA7, TREM2, BIN1, CD2AP, FERMT2, and WWOX were implicated at a nominal significance level or stronger in African American individuals. Pathway analyses strongly support the notion that immunity, lipid processing, and intracellular trafficking pathways underlying Alzheimer disease in African American individuals overlap with those observed in non-Hispanic White individuals. A new pathway emerging from these analyses is the kidney system, suggesting a novel mechanism for Alzheimer disease that needs further exploration. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While the major pathways involved in Alzheimer disease etiology in African American individuals are similar to those in non-Hispanic White individuals, the disease-associated loci within these pathways differ.",01/01/2021,102-113,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 33074286 PMCID: PMC7573798,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33074286,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alzheimer Disease; Black or African American; Genetic Loci,

N-glycosylation is the most common form of glycosylation, and the N-glycan moieties play key roles in regulating protein functions and many other biological processes. Thus, identification and quantification of N-glycome (complete repertoire of all N-glycans in a sample) may provide new sources of biomarkers and shed light on health and disease. To date, little is known about the role of altered N-glycome in Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-related Dementias (AD/ADRD). The current study included 45 older adults who had no cognitive impairment (NCI) at baseline, followed and examined annually, and underwent brain autopsy after death. During about 12-year follow-up, 15 developed mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 15 developed AD, and 15 remained NCI. Relative abundances of N-glycans in serum at 2 time points (baseline and proximate to death, ∼12.3 years apart) and postmortem brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) were quantified using MALDI-TOF-MS. Regression models were used to test the associations of N-glycans with AD/ADRD phenotypes. We detected 71 serum and 141 brain N-glycans, of which 46 were in common. Most serum N-glycans had mean fold changes less than one between baseline and proximate to death. The cross-tissue N-glycan correlations were weak. Baseline serum N-glycans were more strongly associated with AD/ADRD compared to change in serum N-glycans over time and brain N-glycans.

We measured indoor mobility using room-to-room transitions, tested their psychometric properties, and correlated indoor mobility with cognitive and functional status. Materials and Methods: Community-dwelling older adults living alone (n = 139; age = 78.1 ± 8.6 years) from the Oregon Center for Aging & Technology (ORCATECH) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) were included in the study. Two indoor mobility features were developed using non-parametric parameters (frequency; stability): Indoor mobility frequency (room-to-room transitions/day) was detected using passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors fixed on the walls in four geographic locations (bathroom; bedroom; kitchen; living room) and using door contact sensors attached to the egress door in the entrance. Indoor mobility stability was estimated by variances of number of room-to-room transitions over a week. Test-retest reliability (Intra-class coefficient, ICC) and the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined as the standard error of measurement (SEM) were generated. Generalized estimating equations models related mobility features with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and functional status (gait speed). Results: An average of 206 days (±127) of sensor data were analyzed per individual. Indoor mobility frequency and stability showed good to excellent test-retest reliability (ICCs = 0.91[0.88-0.94]; 0.59[0.48-0.70]). The MCIDs of mobility frequency and mobility stability were 18 and 0.09, respectively. On average, a higher indoor mobility frequency was associated with faster gait speed (β = 0.53, p = 0.04), suggesting an increase of 5.3 room-to-room transitions per day was associated with an increase of 10 cm/s gait speed. A decrease in mobility stability was associated with MCI (β = -0.04, p = 0.03). Discussion: Mobility frequency and stability in the home are clinically meaningful and reliable features.

In this study we introduce a novel role for MMP-3 in degrading nerve growth factor (NGF) in vivo and examine its mRNA and protein expression across the continuum of AD pathology. We provide evidence that MMP-3 participates in the degradation of mature NGF in vitro and in vivo and that it is secreted from the rat cerebral cortex in an activity-dependent manner. We show that cortical MMP-3 is upregulated in the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat model of AD-like amyloidosis. A similar upregulation was found in AD and MCI brains as well as in cognitively normal individuals with elevated amyloid deposition. We also observed that frontal cortex MMP-3 protein levels are higher in males. MMP-3 protein correlated with more AD neuropathology, markers of NGF metabolism, and lower cognitive scores in males but not in females. These results suggest that MMP-3 upregulation in AD might contribute to NGF dysmetabolism, and therefore to cholinergic atrophy and cognitive deficits, in a sex-specific manner.

We tested the hypothesis that the impact of individual pathologies associated with progressive parkinsonism differs among older adults. METHODS: Data were from 1089 decedents who had undergone annual clinical testing and autopsy. Parkinsonism was based on a modified United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Linear mixed-effects models were employed, to investigate the combinations of 9 pathologies related to progressive parkinsonism. Then we estimated the person-specific contributions of each pathology for progressive parkinsonism. RESULTS: The average participant showed 3 pathologies. Parkinson's disease (PD) and 4 cerebrovascular pathologies (macroinfarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy [CAA]), but not Alzheimer's disease, TDP-43, hippocampal sclerosis, and microinfarcts, were independently associated with progressive parkinsonism. These pathologies accounted for 13% of additional variance of progressive parkinsonism. Thirty-one different combinations of these 5 pathologies were observed to be associated with progressive parkinsonism observed. On average, PD and CAA accounted, respectively, for 66% and 65% of person-specific progression of parkinsonism, while macroinfarcts, atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis accounted for 41%-48%.

Recent neuroimaging work suggests that the amygdala is sensitive to forms of social adversity and the insula is involved in assessments of trust. We hypothesized that functional connectivity (FC) of these brain regions may be associated with discrimination in older Black adults. One-hundred and twenty-four nondemented older Black adults participating in the Minority Aging Research Study or the Clinical Core study of the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center completed a measure of self-reported experiences of discrimination and a 3T MRI brain scan including structural T1 and resting-state fMRI EPIBOLD sequences. The right and left amygdala and insula regions were anatomically delineated as ROIs according to the Harvard-Oxford Brain Atlas and whole-brain voxelwise FC analyses were conducted using default parameters in the CONN toolbox. In regression analyses controlling for demographics and global cognition, self-reported experiences of discrimination were associated with greater FC between the left insula and the bilateral intracalcarine cortex, weaker FC between the left insula and the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and weaker FC between the right insula and the left supplementary motor area.

Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons require NGF for maintenance of cholinergic phenotype, are critical for cognition, and degenerate early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In AD, NGF metabolism is altered, but it is not known whether this is an early phenomenon, nor how it relates to AD pathology and symptomology. We acquired dorsolateral/medial prefrontal cortex samples from individuals with Alzheimer's dementia, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), or no cognitive impairment with high (HA-NCI) and low (LA-NCI) brain Aβ from the Religious Orders Study. Cortical proNGF protein, but not mRNA, was higher in AD, MCI, and HA-NCI, while mature NGF was lower. Plasminogen protein was higher in MCI and AD brain tissue, with plasminogen mRNA not likewise elevated, suggesting diminished activation of the proNGF convertase, plasmin. The plasminogen activator tPA was lower in HA-NCI while neuroserpin, the CNS tPA inhibitor, was higher in AD and MCI cortical samples. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9), which degrades NGF, was overactive in MCI and AD. Transcription of the MMP9 inhibitor TIMP1 was lower in HA-NCI. ProNGF levels correlated with plasminogen, neuroserpin, and VAChT while NGF correlated with MMP9 activity. In NCI, proNGF correlated with cerebral Aβ and tau deposition and to cognitive performance. In summary, proNGF maturation is impaired in preclinical and clinical AD while mature NGF degradation is enhanced.

METHODS: This study examines knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about brain donation for research among Latinos. Latino men (N=4) and Latina women (N=11) 18 years of age or older with a parental figure age 65 years and over were invited to participate in a focus group. RESULTS: Data analyses revealed 3 themes. Two themes focused on factors influencing a family's willingness to support brain donation: (a) social and cultural contexts, and (b) lack of knowledge and information about the brain donation process. The last theme provided recommendations for engaging older Latino adults in ADRD research and brain donation. DISCUSSION: Results suggest being inclusive of family members during all stages of the research process, from recruitment to dissemination.

LATE-NC often co-occurs with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) pathology. It is currently unknown why some individuals with LATE-NC develop HS while others do not, but genetics may play a role. Previous studies found associations between LATE-NC phenotypes and specific genes: TMEM106B, GRN, ABCC9, KCNMB2, and APOE. Data from research participants with genomic and autopsy measures from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC; n = 631 subjects included) and the Religious Orders Study and Memory and the Rush Aging Project (ROSMAP; n = 780 included) were analyzed in the current study. Our goals were to reevaluate disease-associated genetic variants using newly collected data and to query whether the specific genotype/phenotype associations could provide new insights into disease-driving pathways. Research subjects included in prior LATE/HS genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were excluded. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) within 10 kb of TMEM106B, GRN, ABCC9, KCNMB2, and APOE were tested for association with HS and LATE-NC, and separately for Alzheimer's pathologies, i.e. amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Significantly associated SNVs were identified. When results were meta-analyzed, TMEM106B, GRN, and APOE had significant gene-based associations with both LATE and HS, whereas ABCC9 had significant associations with HS only. In a sensitivity analysis limited to LATE-NC + cases, ABCC9 variants were again associated with HS. By contrast, the associations of TMEM106B, GRN, and APOE with HS were attenuated when adjusting for TDP-43 proteinopathy, indicating that these genes may be associated primarily with TDP-43 proteinopathy. None of these genes except APOE appeared to be associated with Alzheimer's-type pathology.

However, the biological pathways underlying these associations are frequently unknown, limiting understanding of these findings and hindering downstream translational efforts such as drug target discovery. RESULTS: To expand our understanding of the underlying biological pathways and mechanisms controlling blood lipid levels, we leverage a large multi-ancestry meta-analysis (N = 1,654,960) of blood lipids to prioritize putative causal genes for 2286 lipid associations using six gene prediction approaches. Using phenome-wide association (PheWAS) scans, we identify relationships of genetically predicted lipid levels to other diseases and conditions. We confirm known pleiotropic associations with cardiovascular phenotypes and determine novel associations, notably with cholelithiasis risk. We perform sex-stratified GWAS meta-analysis of lipid levels and show that 3-5% of autosomal lipid-associated loci demonstrate sex-biased effects. Finally, we report 21 novel lipid loci identified on the X chromosome. Many of the sex-biased autosomal and X chromosome lipid loci show pleiotropic associations with sex hormones, emphasizing the role of hormone regulation in lipid metabolism.

We obtained a personalized multilevel molecular index of AD dementia progression that predicts severity of neuropathologies, and identified three robust molecular-based subtypes that explain much of the pathologic and clinical heterogeneity of AD. These subtypes present distinct patterns of alteration in DNA methylation, RNA, proteins, and metabolites, identifiable in the brain and subsequently in blood. In addition, the genetic variations that predispose to the various AD subtypes in brain predict distinct spatial patterns of alteration in cell types, suggesting a unique influence of each putative AD variant on neuropathological mechanisms.

However, the effects of APOE4 on the human brain are not fully understood, limiting opportunities to develop targeted therapeutics for individuals carrying APOE4 and other risk factors for Alzheimer's disease4-8. Here, to gain more comprehensive insights into the impact of APOE4 on the human brain, we performed single-cell transcriptomics profiling of post-mortem human brains from APOE4 carriers compared with non-carriers. This revealed that APOE4 is associated with widespread gene expression changes across all cell types of the human brain. Consistent with the biological function of APOE2-6, APOE4 significantly altered signalling pathways associated with cholesterol homeostasis and transport. Confirming these findings with histological and lipidomic analysis of the post-mortem human brain, induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cells and targeted-replacement mice, we show that cholesterol is aberrantly deposited in oligodendrocytes-myelinating cells that are responsible for insulating and promoting the electrical activity of neurons. We show that altered cholesterol localization in the APOE4 brain coincides with reduced myelination. Pharmacologically facilitating cholesterol transport increases axonal myelination and improves learning and memory in APOE4 mice.

Little is known about the role of protein abundance and posttranslational modifications in AD progression and treatment, in particular large-scale intact N-linked glycoproteomics analysis. To elucidate the N-glycoproteome landscape, we developed an approach based on multi-lectin affinity enrichment, hydrophilic interaction chromatography, and LC-MS-based glycoproteomics. We analyzed brain tissue from 10 persons with no cognitive impairment or AD, 10 with asymptomatic AD, and 10 with symptomatic AD, detecting over 300 glycoproteins and 1900 glycoforms across the samples. The majority of glycoproteins have N-glycans that are high-mannosidic or complex chains that are fucosylated and bisected. The Man5 N-glycan was found to occur most frequently at >20% of the total glycoforms. Unlike the glycoproteomes of other tissues, sialylation is a minor feature of the brain N-glycoproteome, occurring at <9% among the glycoforms. We observed AD-associated differences in the number of antennae, frequency of fucosylation, bisection, and other monosaccharides at individual glycosylation sites among samples from our three groups. Further analysis revealed glycosylation differences in subcellular compartments across disease stage, including glycoproteins in the lysosome frequently modified with paucimannosidic glycans.

OBJECTIVE: To identify participants without AD and other neurodegenerative pathologies and determine the extent to which cerebrovascular disease pathologies were associated with cognitive impairment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This clinical pathological study included participants from 2 ongoing community-based cohorts that began enrollment in 1994 and 1997. Prior to death, participants were observed for a mean (SD) of 8.4 (5.3) years with annual assessments. From 2096 participants who died, 1799 (85.8%) underwent autopsy and 1767 had complete postmortem pathological examination data at the time of data analyses. To identify participants without neurodegenerative pathologies, we categorized them in 3 subgroups. A vascular subgroup was composed of participants without significant levels of neurodegenerative brain pathologies. A neurodegenerative subgroup was composed of participants without significant levels of cerebrovascular disease pathologies. A mixed subgroup was composed of the rest of the participants. Data were analyzed from May 2021 to July 2022. EXPOSURES: Brain pathology indices obtained by postmortem pathological assessments. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was cognitive impairment defined by presence of mild cognitive impairment or dementia. The secondary outcome was cognition assessed by 19 neuropsychological tests. RESULTS: Of 1767 included participants, 1189 (67.3%) were women, and the mean (SD) age at death was 89.4 (6.6) years. In the vascular subgroup (n = 369), cognitive impairment was present in 156 participants (42.3%) and was associated with cerebrovascular disease pathologies (macroinfarcts: odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% CI, 1.49-2.82; P < .001; arteriolosclerosis in basal ganglia: OR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.04-1.76; P = .03) but not AD or other neurodegenerative pathologies, an indication of pure VCI. In mixed-effects models including all the pathologies, only macroinfarcts were associated with a faster cognitive decline rate (estimate, -0.019; SE, 0.005; P < .001) in the vascular subgroup. Further analyses identified macroinfarcts in the frontal white matter to be associated with faster cognitive decline rate when macroinfarcts of cortical and subcortical brain regions were examined in a single model.

To overcome these limitations, we propose a scalable Bayesian functional GWAS method to account for multivariate quantitative functional annotations (BFGWAS_QUANT), accompanied by a scalable computation algorithm enabling joint modeling of genome-wide variants. Simulation studies validated the performance of BFGWAS_QUANT for accurately quantifying annotation enrichment and improving GWAS power. Applying BFGWAS_QUANT to study five Alzheimer disease (AD)-related phenotypes using individual-level GWAS data (n = ∼1,000), we found that histone modification annotations have higher enrichment than expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) annotations for all considered phenotypes, with the highest enrichment in H3K27me3 (polycomb regression). We also found that cis-eQTLs in microglia had higher enrichment than eQTLs of bulk brain frontal cortex tissue for all considered phenotypes. A similar enrichment pattern was also identified using the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP) summary-level GWAS data of AD (n = ∼54,000). The strongest known APOE E4 risk allele was identified for all five phenotypes, and the APOE locus was validated using the IGAP data. BFGWAS_QUANT fine-mapped 32 significant variants from 1,073 genome-wide significant variants in the IGAP data. We also demonstrated that the polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using effect size estimates by BFGWAS_QUANT had a similar prediction accuracy as other methods assuming a sparse causal model.

Here, using data from a genome-wide association study of 5.4 million individuals of diverse ancestries, we show that 12,111 independent SNPs that are significantly associated with height account for nearly all of the common SNP-based heritability. These SNPs are clustered within 7,209 non-overlapping genomic segments with a mean size of around 90 kb, covering about 21% of the genome. The density of independent associations varies across the genome and the regions of increased density are enriched for biologically relevant genes. In out-of-sample estimation and prediction, the 12,111 SNPs (or all SNPs in the HapMap 3 panel2) account for 40% (45%) of phenotypic variance in populations of European ancestry but only around 10-20% (14-24%) in populations of other ancestries. Effect sizes, associated regions and gene prioritization are similar across ancestries, indicating that reduced prediction accuracy is likely to be explained by linkage disequilibrium and differences in allele frequency within associated regions. Finally, we show that the relevant biological pathways are detectable with smaller sample sizes than are needed to implicate causal genes and variants. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive map of specific genomic regions that contain the vast majority of common height-associated variants. Although this map is saturated for populations of European ancestry, further research is needed to achieve equivalent saturation in other ancestries.",2022-10,704-712,Nature,PubMed,PMID: 36224396 PMCID: PMC9605867,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36224396,"Genome, Human; Haplotypes; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Chromosome Mapping; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Body Height; Europe; Gene Frequency; Linkage Disequilibrium; Sample Size",

Here we present a causative role of U1 snRNP dysfunction to neurodegeneration in primary neurons and transgenic mice (N40K-Tg), in which N40K expression exerts a dominant-negative effect to downregulate full-length U1-70K. N40K-Tg recapitulates N40K insolubility, erroneous splicing events, neuronal degeneration and cognitive impairment. Specifically, N40K-Tg shows the reduction of GABAergic synapse components (e.g., the GABA receptor subunit of GABRA2), and concomitant postsynaptic hyperexcitability that is rescued by a GABA receptor agonist. Crossing of N40K-Tg and the 5xFAD amyloidosis model indicates that the RNA splicing defect synergizes with the amyloid cascade to remodel the brain transcriptome and proteome, deregulate synaptic proteins, and accelerate cognitive decline. Thus, our results support the contribution of U1 snRNP-mediated splicing dysfunction to AD pathogenesis.",2022-10,923-940,Nat Aging,PubMed,PMID: 36636325 PMCID: PMC9833817,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36636325,"Animals; Mice; RNA Splicing; Proteome; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Ribonucleoprotein, U1 Small Nuclear",

Here, in cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses of 110,182 patients who have had a stroke (five ancestries, 33% non-European) and 1,503,898 control individuals, we identify association signals for stroke and its subtypes at 89 (61 new) independent loci: 60 in primary inverse-variance-weighted analyses and 29 in secondary meta-regression and multitrait analyses. On the basis of internal cross-ancestry validation and an independent follow-up in 89,084 additional cases of stroke (30% non-European) and 1,013,843 control individuals, 87% of the primary stroke risk loci and 60% of the secondary stroke risk loci were replicated (P < 0.05). Effect sizes were highly correlated across ancestries. Cross-ancestry fine-mapping, in silico mutagenesis analysis3, and transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association analyses revealed putative causal genes (such as SH3PXD2A and FURIN) and variants (such as at GRK5 and NOS3). Using a three-pronged approach4, we provide genetic evidence for putative drug effects, highlighting F11, KLKB1, PROC, GP1BA, LAMC2 and VCAM1 as possible targets, with drugs already under investigation for stroke for F11 and PROC. A polygenic score integrating cross-ancestry and ancestry-specific stroke GWASs with vascular-risk factor GWASs (integrative polygenic scores) strongly predicted ischaemic stroke in populations of European, East Asian and African ancestry5. Stroke genetic risk scores were predictive of ischaemic stroke independent of clinical risk factors in 52,600 clinical-trial participants with cardiometabolic disease.

New experimental systems that monitor neuronal functions in conditions approximating the AD brain may be beneficial for identifying new therapeutic strategies. METHODS: We expose cultured neurons to aqueous-soluble human brain extract from 43 individuals across a spectrum of AD pathology. Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) and live-cell imaging were used to assess neuronal firing and neurite integrity (NI), respectively, following treatments of rat cortical neurons (MEA) and human iPSC-derived neurons (iN) with human brain extracts. RESULTS: We observe associations between spontaneous activity and Aβ42:40 levels, between neurite integrity and oligomeric Aβ, and between neurite integrity and tau levels present in the brain extracts. However, these associations with Aβ and tau do not fully account for the effects observed. Proteomic profiling of the brain extracts revealed additional candidates correlated with neuronal structure and activity. Neurotoxicity in MEA and NI assays was associated with proteins implicated in lysosomal storage disorders, while neuroprotection was associated with proteins of the WAVE regulatory complex controlling actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Elevated ganglioside GM2 activator (GM2A) associates with reductions in both NI and MEA activity, and cell-derived GM2A alone is sufficient to induce a loss of neurite integrity and a reduction in neuronal firing.

Resting-state functional neuroimaging approaches may be particularly sensitive to early cognitive decline, but there are no studies that we know of that apply this approach to examining associations of brain function to cognition in older Black adults. We investigated the association of cognitive decline with whole-brain voxel-wise functional connectivity to the hippocampus, a key brain region functionally implicated in early Alzheimer's dementia, in 132 older Black adults without dementia participating in the Minority Aging Research Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, two longitudinal studies of aging that include harmonized annual cognitive assessments and magnetic resonance imaging brain imaging. In models adjusted for demographic factors (age, education, sex), global cognitive decline was associated with functional connectivity of the hippocampus to three clusters in the right and left frontal regions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In domain-specific analyses, decline in semantic memory was associated with functional connectivity of the hippocampus to bilateral clusters in the precentral gyrus, and decline in perceptual speed was inversely associated with connectivity of the hippocampus to the bilateral intracalcarine cortex and the right fusiform gyrus. These findings elucidate neurobiological mechanisms underlying cognitive decline in older Black adults and may point to specific targets of intervention for Alzheimer's disease.",2022-11,5044-5052,Hum Brain Mapp,PubMed,PMID: 36066181 PMCID: PMC9582363,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36066181,Adult; Aged; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; cognitive decline; functional connectivity; hippocampus; Hippocampus; Neuroimaging; resting-state fMRI,

METHODS: We used serum from 631 community-dwelling individuals from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project who were without cognitive impairment at baseline. ccf-gDNA fragments in serum were quantified using digital PCR. An array of cognitive and physical traits, risk of dementia, global cognition, and frailty at or nearest the time of blood draw were regressed on ccf-DNA, with adjustment for age, sex, race, and education. RESULTS: Cross-sectionally, higher ccf-gDNA levels were associated with lower global cognition score and slower gait speed at the evaluation nearest to blood draw. Higher ccf-gDNA levels were associated with increased odds of incident dementia (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05, 1.54).

Previous studies using bulk human brain tissue reported 12 proteins associated with cognitive reserve. This study examined whether the same proteins from induced neurons (iNs) are associated with cognitive reserve of their human donors. METHODS: Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines were generated from cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells of older adults who were autopsied as part of the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project. Neurons were induced from iPSCs using a standard neurogenin2 protocol. Tandem mass tag proteomics analyses were conducted on iNs day 21. Cognitive reserve of their human donors was measured as person-specific slopes of cognitive change not accounted for by common neuropathologies. RESULTS: The 53 human donors died at a mean age of 91 years, all were non-Latino White, and 36 (67.9%) were female. Eighteen were diagnosed with Alzheimer dementia proximate to death, and 34 had pathologic AD diagnosis at autopsy. Approximately 60% of the donors had above-average cognitive reserve such that their cognition declined slower than an average person with comparable burdens of neuropathologies. Eight of the 12 candidate proteins were quantified in iNs proteomics analyses. Higher adenylate kinase 4 (AK4) expression in iNs was associated with lower cognitive reserve, consistent with the previous report for brain AK4 expression.

Epigenetic clocks are promising tools for the quantification of biological aging, yet we hypothesize that investigation of brain aging in AD will be assisted by the development of brain-specific epigenetic clocks. Therefore, we generated a novel age predictor termed PCBrainAge that was trained solely in cortical samples.

However, such multimodal templates have not been constructed for the brain of older adults. The purpose of this work was threefold: (A) to introduce an iterative method for construction of multimodal T1w and DTI templates that aims at maximizing the quality of each template separately as well as the spatial matching between templates, (B) to use this method to develop T1w and DTI templates of the older adult brain in a common space, and (C) to evaluate the performance of the method across iterations and compare it to the performance of state-of-the-art approaches based on multichannel registration. It was demonstrated that more iterations of the proposed method enhanced the characteristics and spatial matching of the resulting T1w and DTI templates. The templates of the older adult brain generated by the final iteration of the proposed method provided better delineation of brain structures, higher discriminability between tissues, and higher image sharpness near the cortex compared to templates generated with approaches employing multichannel registration. In addition, the spatial matching between the T1w and DTI templates constructed by the proposed method approximated the template alignment achieved with methods employing multichannel registration.

An interaction between CVRFs and genetic variants might explain the pathogenesis. Genome-wide, gene by CVRF interaction analyses for AD, in 6568 patients and 8101 controls identified FMNL2 (p = 6.6 × 10-7). A significant increase in FMNL2 expression was observed in the brains of patients with brain infarcts and AD pathology and was associated with amyloid and phosphorylated tau deposition. FMNL2 was also prominent in astroglia in AD among those with cerebrovascular pathology. Amyloid toxicity in zebrafish increased fmnl2a expression in astroglia with detachment of astroglial end feet from blood vessels. Knockdown of fmnl2a prevented gliovascular remodeling, reduced microglial activity and enhanced amyloidosis. APP/PS1dE9 AD mice also displayed increased Fmnl2 expression and reduced the gliovascular contacts independent of the gliotic response. Based on this work, we propose that FMNL2 regulates pathology-dependent plasticity of the blood-brain-barrier by controlling gliovascular interactions and stimulating the clearance of extracellular aggregates.

Studying individuals who are resilient to the cognitive consequences of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology may uncover novel therapeutic targets to treat Alzheimer's disease. It is well established that there are sex differences in response to Alzheimer's disease pathology, and growing evidence suggests that genetic factors may contribute to these differences. Taken together, we sought to elucidate sex-specific genetic drivers of resilience. We extended our recent large scale genomic analysis of resilience in which we harmonized cognitive data across four cohorts of cognitive ageing, in vivo amyloid PET across two cohorts, and autopsy measures of amyloid neuritic plaque burden across two cohorts. These data were leveraged to build robust, continuous resilience phenotypes. With these phenotypes, we performed sex-stratified [n (males) = 2093, n (females) = 2931] and sex-interaction [n (both sexes) = 5024] genome-wide association studies (GWAS), gene and pathway-based tests, and genetic correlation analyses to clarify the variants, genes and molecular pathways that relate to resilience in a sex-specific manner. Estimated among cognitively normal individuals of both sexes, resilience was 20-25% heritable, and when estimated in either sex among cognitively normal individuals, resilience was 15-44% heritable. In our GWAS, we identified a female-specific locus on chromosome 10 [rs827389, β (females) = 0.08, P (females) = 5.76 × 10-09, β (males) = -0.01, P(males) = 0.70, β (interaction) = 0.09, P (interaction) = 1.01 × 10-04] in which the minor allele was associated with higher resilience scores among females. This locus is located within chromatin loops that interact with promoters of genes involved in RNA processing, including GATA3. Finally, our genetic correlation analyses revealed shared genetic architecture between resilience phenotypes and other complex traits, including a female-specific association with frontotemporal dementia and male-specific associations with heart rate variability traits. We also observed opposing associations between sexes for multiple sclerosis, such that more resilient females had a lower genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, and more resilient males had a higher genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Overall, we identified sex differences in the genetic architecture of resilience, identified a female-specific resilience locus and highlighted numerous sex-specific molecular pathways that may underly resilience to Alzheimer's disease pathology. This study illustrates the need to conduct sex-aware genomic analyses to identify novel targets that are unidentified in sex-agnostic models.

We tested the hypothesis that older adults using statins have a lower risk of developing parkinsonism. METHODS: We studied older adults with annual clinical testing of 4 parkinsonian signs and assessment of statin use based on inspection of all medications. Parkinsonism was present if there was clinical evidence of ≥2 parkinsonian signs. Postmortem brain examination collected indices of pathologies, including atherosclerosis of the large vessels of the circle of Willis. We examined whether baseline statin use was related to incident parkinsonism. Then in decedents, we examined whether statin use before death was related to pathologies and whether pathologies linked the association of statin use to parkinsonism. RESULTS: Mean age of the participants (n = 2,841) at study baseline was 76.3 years (SD 7.4 years), and 75% were women. During an average follow-up of 6 years (mean 5.6 years, SD 4.9 years), 50% (n = 1,432) of participants developed parkinsonism. Statin use at baseline (n = 936) was associated with a lower risk of parkinsonism (hazard ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96, p = 0.008), controlling for demographics, vascular risk factors, and diseases. Among the decedents (n = 1,044, mean age at death 89.2 years, SD 6.7 years), statin use before death was associated with a lower odds of atherosclerosis (odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.50-0.79, p < 0.001). In a mediation analysis, both a direct (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54-0.93, p = 0.008) and an indirect (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.97, p = 0.002) pathway via less severe atherosclerosis linked statins to parkinsonism, indicating that atherosclerosis mediated 17% of the association between statins and parkinsonism. DISCUSSION: Adults using statins have a lower risk of parkinsonism that may be partially mediated by a lower odds of brain atherosclerosis. These findings highlight the role of cerebrovascular pathologies in late-life parkinsonism and suggest a potential role for statins in decreasing its magnitude.

We investigated whether WMHs modify the association between late-life BP and cognition within older Black adults. METHODS: A total of 167 Black adults (age, ~75 years; without dementia at baseline) participating in neuroimaging studies at the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center were evaluated for BP markers of cardiovascular health, including systolic BP, diastolic BP, pulse pressure, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and hypertension, and were assessed for global and domain-specific cognition at baseline and annually for up to 8 years. WMHs adjusted for intracranial volume were quantified at baseline. RESULTS: Models adjusted for relevant confounders and the interaction of these variables with time revealed differential associations between BP markers and baseline cognition; however, only elevated diastolic BP predicted faster cognitive, that is, episodic memory, decline (estimate = -0.002, standard error = 0.0009, p = .002). Although WMH burden did not modify the association between diastolic BP and episodic memory decline, it did interact with diastolic BP to lower episodic memory at baseline (estimate = -0.051, standard error = 0.012, p = .0001); that is, greater WMHs combined with higher diastolic BP resulted in the lowest baseline episodic memory scores. A similar profile was noted for WMHs, MAP, and baseline episodic memory. Hypertension was neither associated with cognition nor modified by WMH burden after multiple comparisons correction. CONCLUSION: Late-life diastolic BP was associated with faster rates of episodic memory decline in older Black adults; together with higher WMH burden, it (and MAP) lowered the point at which individuals begin their course of decline toward pathological aging.",01/05/2022,437-445,Psychosom Med,PubMed,PMID: 35100182 PMCID: PMC9064910,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35100182,Adult; Aged; Humans; Cognition; Blood Pressure; Hypertension; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; White Matter,

We aimed to identify genes that confer PTSD risk through their effects on brain protein abundance to provide new insights into PTSD pathogenesis. To that end, we integrated human brain proteomes with PTSD GWAS results to perform a proteome-wide association study (PWAS) of PTSD, followed by Mendelian randomization, using a discovery and confirmatory study design. Brain proteomes (N = 525) were profiled from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using mass spectrometry. The Million Veteran Program (MVP) PTSD GWAS (n = 186,689) was used for the discovery PWAS, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium PTSD GWAS (n = 174,659) was used for the confirmatory PWAS. To understand whether genes identified at the protein-level were also evident at the transcript-level, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using human brain transcriptomes (N = 888) and the MVP PTSD GWAS results. We identified 11 genes that contribute to PTSD pathogenesis via their respective cis-regulated brain protein abundance. Seven of 11 genes (64%) replicated in the confirmatory PWAS and 4 of 11 also had their cis-regulated brain mRNA levels associated with PTSD. High confidence level was assigned to 9 of 11 genes after considering evidence from the confirmatory PWAS and TWAS. Most of the identified genes are expressed in other PTSD-relevant brain regions and several are preferentially expressed in excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells.

However, the precise mechanistic effects of most of these variants have yet to be determined. Deeply phenotyped cohort data can reveal physiological changes associated with genetic risk for AD across an age spectrum that may provide clues to the biology of the disease. We utilized over 2000 high-quality quantitative measurements obtained from blood of 2831 cognitively normal adult clients of a consumer-based scientific wellness company, each with CLIA-certified whole-genome sequencing data. Measurements included: clinical laboratory blood tests, targeted chip-based proteomics, and metabolomics. We performed a phenome-wide association study utilizing this diverse blood marker data and 25 known AD genetic variants and an AD-specific polygenic risk score (PGRS), adjusting for sex, age, vendor (for clinical labs), and the first four genetic principal components; sex-SNP interactions were also assessed. We observed statistically significant SNP-analyte associations for five genetic variants after correction for multiple testing (for SNPs in or near NYAP1, ABCA7, INPP5D, and APOE), with effects detectable from early adulthood. The ABCA7 SNP and the APOE2 and APOE4 encoding alleles were associated with lipid variability, as seen in previous studies; in addition, six novel proteins were associated with the e2 allele. The most statistically significant finding was between the NYAP1 variant and PILRA and PILRB protein levels, supporting previous functional genomic studies in the identification of a putative causal variant within the PILRA gene. We did not observe associations between the PGRS and any analyte. Sex modified the effects of four genetic variants, with multiple interrelated immune-modulating effects associated with the PICALM variant. In post-hoc analysis, sex-stratified GWAS results from an independent AD case-control meta-analysis supported sex-specific disease effects of the PICALM variant, highlighting the importance of sex as a biological variable. Known AD genetic variation influenced lipid metabolism and immune response systems in a population of non-AD individuals, with associations observed from early adulthood onward. Further research is needed to determine whether and how these effects are implicated in early-stage biological pathways to AD.

Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) pathology is often comorbid with LATE-NC, but the clinical and pathologic correlates of HS in LATE-NC are not well understood. METHODS: This retrospective autopsy cohort study used data derived from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Neuropathology Data Set, which included neurologic status, medical histories, and neuropathologic results. All autopsies were performed in 2014 or later. Among participants with LATE-NC, those who also had HS pathology were compared with those without HS with regard to candidate risk factors or common underlying diseases. Statistical significance was set at nominal p < 0.05 in this exploratory study. RESULTS: A total of 408 participants were included (n = 221 were LATE-NC+/HS-, n = 145 were LATE-NC+/HS+, and n = 42 were LATE-NC-/HS+). Most of the included LATE-NC+ participants were severely impaired cognitively (83.3% with dementia). Compared to HS- participants, LATE-NC+ participants with HS trended toward having worse cognitive status and scored lower on the Personal Care and Orientation domains (both p = 0.03). Among LATE-NC+ participants with Braak neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) stages 0 to IV (n = 88), HS+ participants were more impaired in the Memory and Orientation domains (both p = 0.02). There were no differences (HS+ compared with HS-) in the proportion with clinical histories of seizures, stroke, cardiac bypass procedures, diabetes, or hypertension. The HS+ group lacking TDP-43 proteinopathy (n = 42) was relatively likely to have had strokes (p = 0.03). When LATE-NC+ participants with or without HS were compared, there were no differences in Alzheimer disease neuropathologies (Thal β-amyloid phases or Braak NFT stages) or Lewy body pathologies. However, the HS+ group was less likely to have amygdala-restricted TDP-43 proteinopathy (LATE-NC stage 1) and more likely to have neocortical TDP-43 proteinopathy (LATE-NC stage 3) (p < 0.001). LATE-NC+ brains with HS also tended to have more severe circle of Willis atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis pathologies. DISCUSSION: In this cohort skewed toward participants with severe dementia, LATE-NC+ HS pathology was not associated with seizures or with Alzheimer-type pathologies. Rather, the presence of comorbid HS pathology was associated with more widespread TDP-43 proteinopathy and with more severe non-β-amyloid vessel wall pathologies.",05/04/2022,e1422-e1433,Neurology,PubMed,PMID: 35121671 PMCID: PMC8992604,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35121671,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Humans; DNA-Binding Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Hippocampus; TDP-43 Proteinopathies; Retrospective Studies; Sclerosis",

Thus, we quantified associations of modifiable, psychosocial risk factors to years of delayed onset of dementia. DESIGN: Two prospective cohorts (n=2860) with negative and positive psychosocial factors measured at baseline (depressive symptoms, neuroticism, cognitive activity). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Religious Orders Study of older priests, nuns and brothers across the USA, initiated in 1994; Rush Memory and Aging Project, of older persons in Chicago area, initiated in 1997. OUTCOME MEASURE: We conducted annual neurological and neuropsychological assessments to identify AD (n=785 incident cases). We compared age at diagnosis of AD across psychosocial risk factor groups, controlling for confounders, using accelerated failure time models. RESULTS: We found strong relations of three or more depressive symptoms with age at AD diagnosis; estimated mean age at diagnosis was 86.9 years with significant symptoms versus 92.1 years with no symptoms (p=0.001). In addition, neuroticism was inversely related to age at AD diagnosis; estimated mean age at diagnosis was 88.8 years for the highest neuroticism tertile and 93.1 years in the lowest tertile (p<0.001). Participants with higher cognitive activity (such as reading books) had later AD diagnosis; estimated mean age at diagnosis was 89.2 years for the lowest cognitive activity group and 92.6 years for the highest activity group (p<0.001).

Brain autopsy diagnoses of AD, Lewy body disease (LBD), cerebral amyloid angiopathy, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, cerebrovascular disease, hippocampal sclerosis, and no known pathology were examined. Autopsy data collected from January 2012 to January 2018 were deidentified and compiled into the publicly available v. 10 database. Data were analyzed from February 2021 to August 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was NPIQ domain score, if present at any time point, and mean NPIQ domain score during follow-up was secondary. Associations of ADRD diagnoses with 12 NPIQ symptom domains were examined in regression analyses, correcting for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: The study sample of 1808 adults had a mean (SD) age of 80.0 (11.0) years, and 987 participants (54.6%) were male. Apathy was the most prevalent NPS, reaching 80% (203 of 254 individuals) in those with hippocampal sclerosis. Cerebrovascular disease showed few NPS associations. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration was associated with increased apathy, increased disinhibition, and decreased psychosis and agitation compared with AD. Hippocampal sclerosis was associated with increased apathy (odds ratio, 2.60; 95% CI; 1.86-3.66, false discovery rate controlled P < .001) and disinhibition (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.63-2.84; false discovery rate controlled P < .001).

Multiple linear regression and logistic regression models were used to determine whether TBI with or without LOC (compared with no TBI exposure as the reference group) was associated with neuropathologic outcomes after adjusting for age at death, sex, and educational level. Whether the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele and sex differences modified associations was also examined. RESULTS: A total of 1689 participants (1138 [67%] women and 551 [33%] men; mean [SD] age at death, 89.2 [6.7] years; 80 [5%] Black, 46 [3%] Latino, 1639 [97%] non-Latino, and 1601 [95%] White) participated in the study. Compared with participants without TBI, participants with TBI with LOC had a greater amyloid-β load (estimate, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.06-0.43; P = .008) and higher odds of having 1 or more gross infarcts (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.04-2.02; P = .02) and 1 or more microinfarcts (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.21-2.38; P = .002), particularly subcortical microinfarcts (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.23-2.79; P = .002). Those with TBI without LOC had higher odds of neocortical Lewy bodies (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.87; P = .04) and 1 or more cortical microinfarcts (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.09-1.87; P = .008). The association of TBI with and without LOC with vascular pathologic outcomes persisted after controlling for vascular risk factors and vascular disease burden. Traumatic brain injury with or without LOC was not associated with paired helical filament tangles, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43, or hippocampal sclerosis. No interactions occurred with APOE ε4 or sex. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional analysis suggests that a history of TBI, even without LOC, is associated with age-related neuropathologic outcomes, both neurodegenerative and vascular. The variation in the neuropathologic outcomes in individuals with and without LOC may provide clues to potential mechanisms, diagnoses, and management in persons with TBI.",01/04/2022,e229311,JAMA Netw Open,PubMed,PMID: 35476062 PMCID: PMC9047640,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35476062,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Amyloid beta-Peptides; DNA-Binding Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sclerosis; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Independent Living; Infarction; Unconsciousness",

Here, we investigate whether mild behavioral impairment (MBI), the late-life onset of persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), improves the prognostic specificity of MCI. METHODS: Participants with MCI from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center Uniform Data Set were included. NPS were operationalized with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire to identify participants without NPS and those with MBI (persistent, late-onset NPS). Individuals with late-onset NPS not meeting the MBI persistence criterion (NPS_NOT_MBI) were retained for secondary analyses. Progression to dementia, stable MCI, and reversion to NC after 3 years of follow-up were defined per National Institute on Aging-Alzheimer's Association and Petersen criteria. RESULTS: The primary sample consisted of 739 participants (NPS- n = 409 and MBI+ n = 330; 75.16 ± 8.6 years old, 40.5% female). After 3 years, 238 participants (33.6%) progressed to dementia, and 90 (12.2%) reverted to NC. Compared to participants without NPS, participants with MBI were significantly more likely to progress to dementia (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.13, 95% CI 1.52-2.99), with an annual progression rate of 14.7% (vs 8.3% for participants with MCI without NPS). Compared to participants without NPS, participants with MBI were less likely to revert to NC (AOR 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.83, 2.5% vs 5.3% annual reversion rate). The NPS_NOT_MBI group (n = 331, 76.5 ± 8.6 years old, 45.9% female) were more likely to progress to dementia (AOR 2.18, 95% CI 1.56-3.03, 14.3% annual progression rate) but not less likely to revert to NC than those without NPS. Accordingly, both NPS_NOT_MBI and MBI+ participants had lower Mini-Mental State Examination scores than NPS- participants after 3 years. DISCUSSION: Late-onset NPS improve the specificity of MCI as an at-risk state for progression to dementia. However, only persistent late-onset NPS are associated with a lower likelihood of reversion to NC, with transient NPS (i.e., NPS_NOT_MBI) not differing from the NPS- group. Clinical prognostication can be improved by incorporating late-onset NPS, especially those that persist (i.e., MBI), into risk assessments.

We tested whether aggregating cortical peptides associated with cognitive resilience into an index can identify adults with higher or lower cognitive resilience. METHODS: We used data from 1,192 older decedents, including annual clinical testing, indices of 10 Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementia (ADRD) pathologies, and 226 proteotypic peptides measured in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. We used linear mixed-effects models to identify peptides that were related to cognitive resilience (i.e., cognitive decline not explained by ADRD pathologies [false discovery rate <0.05]). We aggregated the expression levels of these resilience peptides into a person-specific cognitive resilience index and examined its association with AD clinical and pathologic phenotypes. RESULTS: We constructed a resilience index from 52 of 226 peptides related to cognitive resilience. A higher index was associated with slower cognitive decline (estimate 0.05, SE 0.003, p < 0.001) and slower motor decline (estimate 0.005, SE 0.001, p < 0.001). Most resilience peptides (70%) were specific to cognitive decline, but 30% also provided resilience for motor decline. A higher index was also related to a lower burden of AD pathologies (odds ratio [OR] 0.41, SE 0.01, p < 0.001) and modified the association of AD pathology with cognition in that a higher index modified the negative effects of AD pathology on AD dementia proximate to death (OR 0.70, SE 0.14, p = 0.010). Up to 90% of cognitive resilience peptides were related to AD pathologic phenotypes. DISCUSSION: Cortical proteins may provide some degree of cognitive resilience. These multifunctional proteins also seem to provide resilience to other AD clinical phenotypes and have independent associations with ADRD pathologies.

We identify global cognitive outcome trajectories and associated predictor variables that may inform clinical research and care. DESIGN: Data derived from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set were used to examine the cognitive course of persons with possible or probable AD, a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) of ≥10, and complete annual assessments for 5 years. SETTING: Thirty-six Alzheimer's Disease Research Centers. PARTICIPANTS: Four hundred and fourteen persons. MEASUREMENTS: We used a hybrid approach comprising qualitative analysis of MMSE trajectory graphs that were operationalized empirically and binary logistic regression analyses to assess 19 variables' associations with each trajectory. MMSE scores of ±3 points or greater were considered clinically meaningful. RESULTS: Five distinct cognitive trajectories were identified: fast decliners (32.6%), slow decliners (30.7%), zigzag stable (15.9%), stable (15.9%), and improvers (4.8%). The decliner groups had three subtypes: curvilinear, zigzag, and late decline. The fast decliners were associated with female gender, lower baseline MMSE scores, a shorter illness duration, or receiving a cognitive enhancer. An early MMSE decline of ≥3 points predicted a worse outcome. A higher rate of traumatic brain injury, the absence of an ApoE ϵ4 allele, and male gender were the strongest predictors of favorable outcomes.

Demographic characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between patients with MCI with or without an experience of reversion to normal cognition (referred to as reverters and nonreverters, respectively). We also compared longitudinal changes in cortical thickness, glucose metabolism, and amyloid and tau load in a subcohort of reverters and nonreverters in MCSA with MRI or PET imaging information from multiple visits. RESULTS: We identified 164 (56.4%) individuals in MCSA, 508 (66.8%) individuals in ROSMAP, and 280 (34.1%) individuals in NACC who experienced MCI reversion to normal cognition. Cox proportional hazards regression models showed that MCI reverters had an increased chance of being cognitively normal at the last visit in MCSA (HR 3.31, 95% CI 2.14-5.12), ROSMAP (HR 3.72, 95% CI 2.50-5.56), and NACC (HR 9.29, 95% CI 6.45-13.40) and a reduced risk of progression to dementia (HR 0.12, 95% CI 0.05-0.29 in MCSA; HR 0.41, 95% CI 0.32-0.53 in ROSMAP; and HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.21-0.40 in NACC).

METHODS: The study used data from National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center participants with dementia and an etiologic diagnosis of AD, Lewy body disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD, with or without motor neuron disease), or vascular dementia. Analyses included median survival across dementia types and predictors of death at 5 years based on baseline demographics and clinical measure performance. Five-year survival probability tables were stratified by predictor values. RESULTS: Individuals with AD had the longest survival (median 6 years), followed by FTLD (5 years), and vascular dementia and LBD (each 4 years). The strongest predictors of death for the full cohort were dementia type (higher risk with non-AD dementias), sex (higher risk with male sex), and race and ethnicity (higher risk with white and non-Hispanic participants). Age was associated with higher mortality risk across the non-Alzheimer dementias; other significant associations included worse cognitive status (FTLD, LBD) and more depression (LBD).

Watershed brain regions are located at the most distal areas between arterial territories, making them vulnerable to SVD-related changes. We examined the association of pathologic markers of SVD, specifically arteriolosclerosis in watershed brain regions, with AD pathologic changes. Participants (N = 982; mean age-at-death = 90; 69% women) were enrolled as part of one of two cohort studies of aging and dementia. At autopsy, neuropathological evaluation included semi-quantitative grading of arteriolosclerosis pathology from 2 cortical watershed regions: the anterior watershed (AWS) and posterior watershed (PWS), densities for cortical β-amyloid and tau-tangle pathology, and other common age-related pathologies. Linear regression models examined the association of watershed arteriolosclerosis pathology with β-amyloid and tau-tangle burden. In follow-up analyses, available ex-vivo MRI and proteomics data in a subset of decedents were leveraged to examine the association of whole brain measure of WMH, as a presumed MRI marker of SVD, with β-amyloid and tau-tangle burden, as well as to examine the association of watershed arteriolosclerosis with proteomic tau. Watershed arteriolosclerosis was common, with 45% of older persons having moderate-to-severe arteriolosclerosis pathology in the AWS region, and 35% in the PWS. In fully adjusted models that controlled for demographics and common age-related pathologies, an increase in severity of PWS arteriolosclerosis was associated with a higher burden of tau-tangle burden, specifically neocortical tau burden, but not with β-amyloid. AWS arteriolosclerosis was not associated with β-amyloid or tau pathology. Ex-vivo WMH was associated with greater tau-tangle pathology burden but not β-amyloid. Furthermore, PWS arteriolosclerosis was associated with higher abundance of tau phosphopeptides, that promote formation of tau aggregates.

OBJECTIVE: This study seeks to identify baseline characteristics in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) that correlate with eventual conversion to DLB or Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Baseline neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric data were analyzed in National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center participants who completed the Uniform Data Set between 2006 and 2020 and subsequently converted from MCI to DLB or AD (n = 1632). RESULTS: Only 6% of participants with MCI converted to DLB. Among those who converted to DLB, multidomain amnestic MCI (aMCI) was the most common subtype at study entry. As part of logistic regression analyses, odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for conversion to DLB versus AD based on study-entry characteristics, adjusting for age, sex, education, and years to diagnosis. The strongest predictors of conversion to DLB (p≤0.0001) were nonamnestic MCI versus aMCI (OR 8.2, CI [5.0, 14]), multidomain MCI versus single-domain MCI (OR 2.7, CI [1.7. 4.2]), male sex (OR 4.2, CI [2.5, 7.1]), and presence of nighttime behaviors (OR 4.4 CI [2.8, 6.9]). CONCLUSION: A diagnosis of prodromal DLB should be considered in individuals with MCI who present with prominent executive/visuospatial deficits, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and less memory impairment.

Variation in cognitive trajectory is only partially explained by traditional neuropathologies. We sought to identify novel genes associated with cognitive trajectory using DNA methylation profiles from human postmortem brain. METHODS: We performed a brain epigenome-wide association study of cognitive trajectory in 636 participants from the ROS (Religious Orders Study) and MAP (Rush Memory and Aging Project) using DNA methylation profiles of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. To maximize our power to detect epigenetic associations, we used the recently developed Gene Association with Multiple Traits test to analyze the 5 measured cognitive domains simultaneously. RESULTS: We found an epigenome-wide association for differential methylation of sites in the CLDN5 locus and cognitive trajectory (p = 9.96 × 10-7) that was robust to adjustment for cell type proportions (p = 8.52 × 10-7). This association was primarily driven by association with declines in episodic (p = 4.65 × 10-6) and working (p = 2.54 × 10-7) memory. This association between methylation in CLDN5 and cognitive decline was significant even in participants with no or little signs of amyloid-β and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Differential methylation of CLDN5, a gene that encodes an important protein of the blood-brain barrier, is associated with cognitive trajectory beyond traditional Alzheimer's disease pathologies. The association between CLDN5 methylation and cognitive trajectory in people with low pathology suggests an early role for CLDN5 and blood-brain barrier dysfunction in cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.",15/02/2022,389-398,Biol Psychiatry,PubMed,PMID: 33838873 PMCID: PMC8329105,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838873,Humans; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Dementia; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuropathology; DNA Methylation; Epigenetics; Claudin-5; Cognitive trajectory; Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Gene-based analysis,

METHODS: We evaluated the differential expression of previously established AD genes in brains from 344 pathologically confirmed AD cases and 232 controls and in blood from 112 pathologically confirmed AD cases and 67 controls from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project. Differential gene expression between AD cases and controls was analyzed in the blood and brain jointly using a multivariate approach in the total sample and within APOE genotype groups. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed within APOE genotype groups using the results from the combined blood and brain analyses to identify biologically important pathways. Gene co-expression networks in brain and blood samples were investigated using weighted correlation network analysis. Top-ranked genes from networks and pathways were further evaluated with vascular injury traits. RESULTS: We observed differentially expressed genes with P < 0.05 in both brain and blood for established AD genes INPP5D (upregulated) and HLA-DQA1 (downregulated). PIGHP1 and FRAS1 were differentially expressed at the transcriptome-wide level (P < 3.3 × 10-6) within ε2/ε3 and ε3/ε4 groups, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed 21 significant pathways (false discovery rate P < 0.05) in at least one APOE genotype group. Ten pathways were significantly enriched in the ε3/ε4 group, and six of these were unique to these subjects. Four pathways (allograft rejection, interferon gamma response, peroxisome, and TNFA signaling via NFKB) were enriched for AD upregulated genes in the ε3/ε4 group and AD downregulated genes in subjects lacking ε4. We identified a co-expressed gene network in the brain that reproduced in blood and showed higher average expression in ε4 carriers. Twenty-three genes from pathway and network analyses were significantly associated with at least one vascular injury trait.

Therefore, by using a deep neural network that predicts protein abundance from mRNA expression, here we attempt to track the early protein drivers of ADRD. Specifically, by applying the clei2block deep learning model to 1192 brain RNA-seq samples, we identify protein modules and disease-associated expression changes that were not directly observed at the mRNA level. Moreover, pseudo-temporal trajectory inference based on the predicted proteome became more closely correlated with cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy compared to RNA-based trajectories. This suggests that the predicted changes in protein expression could provide a better molecular representation of ADRD progression.

Two such AD-associated modules unique to the proteomic network included a module related to MAPK signaling and metabolism and a module related to the matrisome. The matrisome module was influenced by the APOE ε4 allele but was not related to the rate of cognitive decline after adjustment for neuropathology.

However, the generalizability and comparative utility of current methods of diagnosing MCI and dementia due to Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) are significantly understudied in non-Hispanic Black (NHB) older adults. Thus, we extended our previous investigation to more specifically explore the utility of consensus-based and actuarial diagnostic methods in NHB older adults.Method: We compared baseline consensus and actuarial diagnostic rates, and associations of ratings of functioning with neuropsychological performance and diagnostic outcomes, in NHB (n = 963) and non-Hispanic White (NHW; n = 4577) older adults in the NACC cohort.Results: 60.0% of the NHB subsample, versus 29.2% of the NHW subsample, included participants who met actuarial criteria for MCI despite being classified as CN or impaired-not-MCI per consensus. Additionally, associations between ratings of functioning and neuropsychological performance were less consistent in NHB participants than in NHW participants.Conclusions: Our results provide evidence of differential degrees of association between reported functioning and neuropsychological performance in NHB and NHW older adults, which may contribute to racial group differences in diagnostic rates, and prompt consideration of the strengths and weaknesses of consensus-based and actuarial diagnostic approaches in assessing neurocognitive functioning in NHB older adults.",2022-02,287-310,Clin Neuropsychol,PubMed,PMID: 34499580 PMCID: PMC8849565,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34499580,Aged; Cohort Studies; Humans; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuropsychological Tests,

Biopsychosocial risk factors that differentially affect individuals by race, including health, education, and APOE e4, may explain these findings. Some research suggests that the risk for AD associated with the APOE e4 allele may differ by race. Gender differences in AD have also been identified but remain understudied. We examined race, APOE status, vascular risk factors, education, and the interaction of APOE e4 status and race as predictors of cognitive decline and the development of Alzheimer's disease between genders in a large longitudinal sample of older adults. Methods: Participants (N = 4336) were selected from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center's Uniform Data Set who completed measures of verbal fluency, naming, and immediate/delayed story memory across 5 years. Analyses were stratified by gender. Follow up interactions examined statistical significance of differences. Results: APOE e4 by race interactions were largely non-significant and dropped from most models. When controlling for health, education, referral source, and Uniform Data Set form (when applicable), few racial differences in cognitive performance over time emerged. Black participants obtained lower scores than White participants on a majority of baseline measures. Race findings did not differ by gender. Hypertension was more strongly predictive of decline in delayed memory among women. Conclusions: Analyses did not support that APOE e4 differentially affects Black individuals.

However, the spatiotemporal overlap of markers for pathway dysregulation in different brain regions and cell types presents a challenge for pinpointing causal versus epiphenomenal changes characterizing disease progression. To approach this problem, we performed Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis and STRING interactome analysis of gene expression patterns quantified in frontal cortex samples (Brodmann area 10) from subjects who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment, aMCI, or mild/moderate AD. Frontal cortex was chosen due to the relatively protracted involvement of this region in AD, which might reveal pathways associated with disease onset. A co-expressed network correlating with clinical diagnosis was functionally associated with insulin signaling, with insulin (INS) being the most highly connected gene within the network. Co-expressed networks correlating with neuropathological diagnostic criteria (e.g., NIA-Reagan Likelihood of AD) were associated with platelet-endothelium-leucocyte cell adhesion pathways and hypoxia-oxidative stress.

Therefore, the purpose of this work was twofold: (A) to develop a 0.5mm isotropic resolution standardized T1-weighted template of the older adult brain by applying principles of super resolution to high quality MRI data from 222 older adults (65-95 years of age), and (B) to systematically compare the new template to other standardized and study-specific templates in terms of image quality and performance when used as a reference for alignment of older adult data. The new template exhibited higher spatial resolution and improved visualization of fine structural details of the older adult brain compared to a template constructed using a conventional template building approach and the same data. In addition, the new template exhibited higher image sharpness and did not contain image artifacts observed in some of the other templates considered in this work. Due to the above enhancements, the new template provided higher inter-subject spatial normalization precision for older adult data compared to the other templates, and consequently enabled detection of smaller inter-group morphometric differences in older adult data. Finally, the new template was among those that were most representative of older adult brain data.

Available studies focus primarily on white non-Hispanic samples. OBJECTIVE: We investigated demographic, clinical, and pathological correlates of survival by race and ethnicity in an autopsy-confirmed cohort of LBD cases. METHODS: Using National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center data, we selected participants who self-identified as Black, Hispanic, or white who had neuropathological assessments showing transitional or diffuse LBD pathology. We used Kruskal-Wallis and Pearson χ2 analyses to investigate group differences in demographic and presenting clinical and pathological characteristics. We used linear regressions to identify predictors of survival with sex, age at symptom onset, education, ethnoracial status, LBD pathology type, and Braak tangle stage included in the model. RESULTS: Data from 1,441 white, 60 Black, and 54 Hispanic participants were available for analysis. Hispanics were more likely to have transitional LBD pathology and had a longer survival than white and Black participants. After controlling for demographic and pathological variables, length of survival did not differ between Hispanics and Black or white participants. Additional key findings demonstrated discrepancies between clinical diagnoses received at last visit and pathological findings, particularly among Black participants. CONCLUSION: LBD survival differences by race and ethnicity can be accounted for by LBD pathology type and co-occurring Alzheimer's disease pathology.

Here, we integrate a large GWAS on blood lipids involving 1.6 million individuals from five ancestries with a wide array of functional genomic datasets to discover regulatory mechanisms underlying lipid associations. We first prioritize lipid-associated genes with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) colocalizations and then add chromatin interaction data to narrow the search for functional genes. Polygenic enrichment analysis across 697 annotations from a host of tissues and cell types confirms the central role of the liver in lipid levels and highlights the selective enrichment of adipose-specific chromatin marks in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Overlapping transcription factor (TF) binding sites with lipid-associated loci identifies TFs relevant in lipid biology. In addition, we present an integrative framework to prioritize causal variants at GWAS loci, producing a comprehensive list of candidate causal genes and variants with multiple layers of functional evidence.

However, there is a highly incomplete understanding of the genetic determinants of LATE neuropathologic changes (LATE-NC) in diverse populations. The defining neuropathologic feature of LATE-NC is TDP-43 proteinopathy, often with comorbid hippocampal sclerosis (HS). In terms of genetic risk factors, LATE-NC and/or HS are associated with single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 3 genes-TMEM106B (rs1990622), GRN (rs5848), and ABCC9 (rs1914361 and rs701478). We evaluated these 3 genes in convenience samples of individuals of African ancestry. The allele frequencies of the LATE-associated alleles were significantly different between persons of primarily African (versus European) ancestry: In persons of African ancestry, the risk-associated alleles for TMEM106B and ABCC9 were less frequent, whereas the risk allele in GRN was more frequent. We performed an exploratory analysis of data from African-American subjects processed by the Alzheimer's Disease Genomics Consortium, with a subset of African-American participants (n = 166) having corroborating neuropathologic data through the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC). In this limited-size sample, the ABCC9/rs1914361 SNV was associated with HS pathology.

Human restricted CHRFAM7A has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. METHODS: The physiological role of CHRFAM7A in human brain is explored using multiomics approach on 600 post mortem human brain tissue samples. The emerging pathways and mechanistic hypotheses are tested and validated in an isogenic hiPSC model of CHRFAM7A knock-in medial ganglionic eminence progenitors and neurons. FINDINGS: CHRFAM7A is identified as a modulator of intracellular calcium dynamics and an upstream regulator of Rac1. Rac1 activation re-designs the actin cytoskeleton leading to dynamic actin driven remodeling of membrane protrusion and a switch from filopodia to lamellipodia. The reinforced cytoskeleton leads to an advantage to tolerate stiffer mechanical properties of the extracellular environment. INTERPRETATION: CHRFAM7A modifies the actin cytoskeleton to a more dynamic and stiffness resistant state in an α7nAChR dependent manner. CHRFAM7A may facilitate neuronal adaptation to changes in the brain environment in physiological and pathological conditions contributing to risk or recovery. Understanding how CHRFAM7A affects human brain requires human studies in the areas of memory formation and erasure, cognitive reserve, and neuronal plasticity.

However, it is unclear whether sex-specific cognitive consequences of APOE are consistent across races and extend to the APOE ε2 allele. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether sex and race modify APOE ε4 and ε2 associations with cognition. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This genetic association study included longitudinal cognitive data from 4 AD and cognitive aging cohorts. Participants were older than 60 years and self-identified as non-Hispanic White or non-Hispanic Black (hereafter, White and Black). Data were previously collected across multiple US locations from 1994 to 2018. Secondary analyses began December 2021 and ended September 2022. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Harmonized composite scores for memory, executive function, and language were generated using psychometric approaches. Linear regression assessed interactions between APOE ε4 or APOE ε2 and sex on baseline cognitive scores, while linear mixed-effect models assessed interactions on cognitive trajectories. The intersectional effect of race was modeled using an APOE × sex × race interaction term, assessing whether APOE × sex interactions differed by race. Models were adjusted for age at baseline and corrected for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Of 32 427 participants who met inclusion criteria, there were 19 007 females (59%), 4453 Black individuals (14%), and 27 974 White individuals (86%); the mean (SD) age at baseline was 74 years (7.9). At baseline, 6048 individuals (19%) had AD, 4398 (14%) were APOE ε2 carriers, and 12 538 (38%) were APOE ε4 carriers. Participants missing APOE status were excluded (n = 9266). For APOE ε4, a robust sex interaction was observed on baseline memory (β = -0.071, SE = 0.014; P = 9.6 × 10-7), whereby the APOE ε4 negative effect was stronger in females compared with males and did not significantly differ among races. Contrastingly, despite the large sample size, no APOE ε2 × sex interactions on cognition were observed among all participants. When testing for intersectional effects of sex, APOE ε2, and race, an interaction was revealed on baseline executive function among individuals who were cognitively unimpaired (β = -0.165, SE = 0.066; P = .01), whereby the APOE ε2 protective effect was female-specific among White individuals but male-specific among Black individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, while race did not modify sex differences in APOE ε4, the APOE ε2 protective effect could vary by race and sex. Although female sex enhanced ε4-associated risk, there was no comparable sex difference in ε2, suggesting biological pathways underlying ε4-associated risk are distinct from ε2 and likely intersect with age-related changes in sex biology.",17/07/2023,e232169,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 37459083 PMCID: PMC10352930,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37459083,,

To extend the biomarker literature, associations between serial position scores and postmortem levels of brain phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were examined, in the context of Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangle progression. METHOD: Participants were 1091 community-dwelling adults (Mage = 80.2, 68.9% female) from the Rush University Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project who were non-demented at enrollment and followed for a mean of 9.2 years until death. The CERAD Word List Memory test administered at baseline and within 1 year of death was used to calculate serial position (primacy, recency) and total recall scores. Proteomic analyses quantified p-tau 217 and 202 from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples. Linear regressions assessed associations between cognitive scores and p-tau with Braak stage as a moderator. RESULTS: Cognitive status proximal to death indicated 34.7% were unimpaired, 26.2% met criteria for MCI, and 39.0% for dementia. Better baseline primacy recall, but not recency recall, was associated with lower p-tau 217 levels across Braak stages. Delayed recall showed a similar pattern as primacy. There was no main effect of immediate recall, but an interaction with Braak stages indicated a negative association with p-tau 217 level only in Braak V-VI. Within 1 year of death, there were no main effects for cognitive scores; however, recency, immediate and delayed recall scores interacted with Braak stage showing better recall was associated with lower p-tau 217 only in Braak V-VI. No associations were observed with p-tau 202. CONCLUSIONS: Primacy recall measured in non-demented adults may be sensitive to emergent tau phosphorylation that occurs in the earliest stages of AD.

We investigated whether the two pathologies act synergistically to further potentiate the severity of parkinsonism beyond their separate effects. METHODS: We employed postmortem data of decedents from 3 longitudinal community-based studies of aging who underwent annual clinical evaluation to assess parkinsonian signs using 26-items of the motor portion of a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. A summary score was developed from each item score to construct a global parkinsonian score, with a higher score indicating more severe parkinsonism. A detailed neuropathologic evaluation was performed to identify LB, AD pathology, nigral neuronal loss, atherosclerosis, macroscopic infarcts, and other CVD pathologies (arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and microscopic infarcts). A series of regression models with terms for LB, CVD pathology, and the interaction of LB with CVD pathologies was fit for global parkinsonism proximate- to-death and for individual parkinsonian signs scores including, parkinsonian gait, rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. RESULTS: In 1,753 participants (mean age at death=89 years; 68% women), LB was observed in 26% of participants and CVD pathologies were present in more than two thirds of participants. LB and three CVD pathologies (atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and macroscopic infarcts) were each independently associated with the severity of global parkinsonism proximate-to-death (LB: β=0.318, SE=0.08, p=<0.001, atherosclerosis: β=0.373, SE=0.079, p=<0.001, arteriolosclerosis: β=0.253, SE=0.078, p=0.001, macroscopic infarcts: β=0.333, SE=0.077, p=<0.001). A linear regression model adjusted for demographics, CVD, and neurodegenerative pathologies showed interaction between LB and macroscopic infarcts (β=0.463, SE=0.168, p=0.006), with LBs being associated with worse global parkinsonism when macroinfarcts are present. Similar interactions were found for atherosclerosis and LBs (β=0.371, SE=0.173, p=0.032) as well as for parkinsonian gait as the outcome (macroscopic infarcts: β=0.662, SE=0.239, p=0.005; atherosclerosis: β=0.509, SE=0.246, p=0.038). Findings were not affected when the 66 participants with a clinical diagnosis of PD were excluded. In contrast, there were no interactions between LB and other CVD pathologies or between atherosclerosis and macroscopic infarcts for global parkinsonism proximate-to-death.

OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether a PRS for microglial activation (PRSmic) could augment the predictive performance of existing AD PRSs for late-life cognitive impairment. METHODS: First, PRSmic were calculated and optimized in a calibration cohort (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), n = 450), with resampling. Second, predictive performance of optimal PRSmic was assessed in two independent, population-based cohorts (total n = 212,237). Finally, we explored associations of PRSmic with a comprehensive set of imaging and fluid AD biomarkers in ADNI. RESULTS: Our PRSmic showed no significant improvement in predictive power for either AD diagnosis or cognitive performance in either external cohort. Some nominal associations were found in ADNI, but with inconsistent effect directions.

The postsynaptic protein Shank3 (SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains) is of particular interest, as the loss of a single allele of the SHANK3 gene is sufficient to cause profound cognitive symptoms in children. We thus sought to determine whether a SHANK3 deficiency could contribute to the emergence or worsening of AD symptoms and neuropathology. We first found a 30%-50% postmortem loss of SHANK3a associated with cognitive decline in the parietal cortex of individuals with AD. To further probe the role of SHANK3 in AD, we crossed male and female 3xTg-AD mice modelling Aβ and tau pathologies with Shank3a-deficient mice (Shank3Δex4-9). We observed synergistic deleterious effects of Shank3a deficiency and AD neuropathology on object recognition memory at 9, 12, and 18 months of age and on anxious behavior at 9 and 12 months of age in hemizygous Shank3Δex4-9-3xTg-AD mice. In addition to the expected 50% loss of Shank3a, levels of other synaptic proteins, such as PSD-95, drebrin, and homer1, remained unchanged in the parietotemporal cortex of hemizygous Shank3Δex4-9 animals. However, Shank3a deficiency increased the levels of soluble Aβ42 and human tau at 18 months of age compared with 3xTg-AD mice with normal Shank3 expression. The results of this study in human brain samples and in transgenic mice are consistent with the hypothesis that Shank3 deficiency makes a key contribution to cognitive impairment in AD.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Although the loss of several synaptic proteins has been described in Alzheimer's disease (AD), it remains unclear whether their reduction contributes to clinical symptoms. The results of this study in human samples show lower levels of SHANK3a in AD brain, correlating with cognitive decline.

The cell-type specific and, separately, peptide specific associations of VGF with pathologic and cognitive outcomes remain largely unknown. We leveraged gene expression and protein data from the human neocortex and investigated the VGF associations with common neuropathologies and late-life cognitive decline. METHODS: Community-dwelling older adults were followed every year, died, and underwent brain autopsy. Cognitive decline was captured via annual cognitive testing. Common neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular conditions were assessed during neuropathologic evaluations. Bulk brain RNASeq and targeted proteomics analyses were conducted using frozen tissues from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 1,020 individuals. Cell-type specific gene expressions were quantified in a subsample (N = 424) following single nuclei RNASeq analysis from the same cortex. RESULTS: The bulk brain VGF gene expression was primarily associated with AD and Lewy bodies. The VGF gene association with cognitive decline was in part accounted for by neuropathologies. Similar associations were observed for the VGF protein. Cell-type specific analyses revealed that, while VGF was differentially expressed in most major cell types in the cortex, its association with neuropathologies and cognitive decline was restricted to the neuronal cells. Further, the peptide fragments across the VGF polypeptide resembled each other in relation to neuropathologies and cognitive decline. INTERPRETATION: Multiple pathways link VGF to cognitive health in older age, including neurodegeneration.

Data came from 269 older adults who participated in the Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Blood samples were collected during annual clinical evaluations. Participants died and underwent brain autopsy. P-tau181 and p-tau217 were quantified in the plasma samples proximate to death (average interval before death: 1.4 years) using Lilly-developed MSD immunoassays. Uniform neuropathologic evaluations assessed AD, PART, and other common degenerative and cerebrovascular conditions. Plasma p-tau217 was more strongly correlated with brain β-amyloid and paired helical filament tau (PHFtau) tangles than p-tau181. Both p-tau markers were associated with greater odds of AD, but p-tau217 had higher accuracy (area under the ROC curve (AUC): 0.83) than p-tau181 (AUC: 0.76). Plasma p-tau markers were almost exclusively associated with AD pathologic indices with the exception of cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Compared to p-tau181, p-tau217 showed a higher AUC (0.82 versus 0.74) in differentiating AD from PART. For either p-tau, we did not observe a level difference between individuals with AD alone and those with mixed AD pathologies. In summary, plasma p-tau181and p-tau217 were specifically associated with AD pathological changes. Further, our data provide initial evidence that p-tau217 may be able to differentiate between AD and PART in individuals with comparable burdens of tau tangle pathology.

These cognitively normal people with AD pathology are described as preclinical or asymptomatic AD (AsymAD) and appear to exhibit cognitive resilience to the clinical manifestations of AD dementia. Here we present a comprehensive network-based approach from cases clinically and pathologically defined as asymptomatic AD to map resilience-associated pathways and extend mechanistic validation. Multiplex tandem mass tag MS (TMT-MS) proteomic data (n = 7787 proteins) was generated on brain tissue from Brodmann area 6 and Brodmann area 37 (n = 109 cases, n = 218 total samples) and evaluated by consensus weighted gene correlation network analysis. Notably, neuritin (NRN1), a neurotrophic factor previously linked to cognitive resilience, was identified as a hub protein in a module associated with synaptic biology. To validate the function of NRN1 with regard to the neurobiology of AD, we conducted microscopy and physiology experiments in a cellular model of AD. NRN1 provided dendritic spine resilience against amyloid-β (Aβ) and blocked Aβ-induced neuronal hyperexcitability in cultured neurons. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of resilience to Aβ provided by NRN1, we assessed how exogenous NRN1 alters the proteome by TMT-MS (n = 8238 proteins) of cultured neurons and integrated the results with the AD brain network. This revealed overlapping synapse-related biology that linked NRN1-induced changes in cultured neurons with human pathways associated with cognitive resilience. Collectively, this highlights the utility of integrating the proteome from the human brain and model systems to advance our understanding of resilience-promoting mechanisms and prioritize therapeutic targets that mediate resilience to AD.",2023-05,100542,Mol Cell Proteomics,PubMed,PMID: 37024090 PMCID: PMC10233303,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37024090,Alzheimer’s disease; Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Proteome; Proteomics; aging; proteomics; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; cognition; amyloid; GPI-Linked Proteins; Neuropeptides; synapse,

Y.)",2352-8737,10.1002/trc2.12380,"INTRODUCTION: Acculturation-related characteristics, that is, factors directly connected to culture and familial relationships, are associated with engaged research participation within Latino communities. Despite this, little empirical data exists on whether acculturation changes over time in older Latinos, which has potential implications for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) research study design including longer duration clinical trial implementation. METHODS: Self-identified Latinos (n = 222; mean age = 71, 76% female) participating in one of three ongoing longitudinal community-based cohort studies of aging who reported their nativity outside of the United States/District of Columbia (US/DC) contributed, on average, 4.0 ± 1.2 years of annually collected data. This included acculturation-related characteristics of total, language-, and social-based scores from the Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics (SASH) and total and domain-specific scores from an abbreviated Sabogal Familism questionnaire. We used ordinal mixed effects models and linear mixed effects models (as appropriate) to assess change in acculturation metrics after adjusting for age, sex, education, income, and duration of time in the US/DC. RESULTS: Although none of the SASH metrics changed over time (P-values ≥ 0.25), all Familism metrics declined over time (P-values ≤ 0.044). Additionally, select participant-based characteristics including years of education were significantly (and differentially) associated with level of, but not change in, acculturation-related outcomes. DISCUSSION: Results suggest that specific acculturation-related factors (i.e., familism) change over time in older Latinos, and participant-based characteristics associated with baseline levels of (but not change in) acculturation more generally. Thus, acculturation-related characteristics are not all static, trait-like qualities but rather a multi-faceted, and at times evolving, construct.

However, previously suggested cutoff scores of 26/30 and above is often criticized and lacks racial diversity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential influence of race on MoCA classification cutoff score accuracy. METHOD: Data were obtained from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) Uniform Data Set and yielded 4,758 total participants. Participants were predominately White (82.8%) and female (61.7%) with a mean age of 69.3 years (SD = 10.3) and education level of 16.3 years (SD = 2.6). Based on NACC's classification, participants were either cognitively normal (n = 3,650) or MCI (n = 1,108). RESULTS: Sensitivity and specificity analyses revealed that when using the cutoff score of ≤26/30, the MoCA correctly classified 73.2% of White cognitively normal participants and 83.1% of White MCI participants. In contrast, this criterion correctly classified 40.5% of Black cognitively normal participants and 90.8% of Black MCI participants. Our sample was highly educated; therefore, we did not observe significant differences in scores when accounting for education across race. Classification statistics are presented.

However, our limited understanding of the biological basis of depression has hindered the development of novel treatments and interventions. METHODS: To identify new candidate genes for therapeutic development, we examined single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snucRNAseq) data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (N=424) in relation to ante-mortem depressive symptoms. To complement these direct analyses, we also used genome- wide association study (GWAS) results for depression (N=500,199) along with genetic tools for inferring the expression of 22,159 genes in 7 cell types and 55 cell subtypes to perform transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) of depression followed by Mendelian randomization (MR). RESULTS: Our single-nucleus TWAS analysis identified 71 causal genes in depression that have a role in specific neocortical cell subtypes; 59 of 71 genes were novel compared to previous studies. Depression TWAS genes showed a cell type specific pattern, with the greatest enrichment being in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as astrocytes. Gene expression in different neuron subtypes have different directions of effect on depression risk. Compared to lower genetically correlated traits (e.g. body mass index) with depression, higher correlated traits (e.g., neuroticism) have more common TWAS genes with depression. In parallel, we performed differential gene expression analysis in relation to depression in 55 cortical cell subtypes, and we found that genes such as ANKRD36 , MADD , TAOK3 , SCAI and CHUK are associated with depression in specific cell subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: These two sets of analyses illustrate the utility of large snucRNAseq data to uncover both genes whose expression is altered in specific cell subtypes in the context of depression and to enhance the interpretation of well-powered GWAS so that we can prioritize specific susceptibility genes for further analysis and therapeutic development.",29/03/2023,2023.03.27.23286844,medRxiv,PubMed,PMID: 37034737 PMCID: PMC10081415,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/37034737,,

We found that cortical TREM2 levels were positively related to AD diagnosis, cognitive decline, and amyloid-β neuropathology but were not related to the proportion of activated microglia. In contrast, caudate TREM2 levels were not related to AD pathology, cognition, or diagnosis, but were positively related to the proportion of activated microglia in the same region. Diagnosis-stratified results revealed caudate TREM2 levels were inversely related to AD neuropathology and positively related to microglial activation and longitudinal cognitive performance in AD cases.

We now examine this conceptual framework as related to level of and change in cardiovascular health, and whether cardiovascular health modifies previously documented associations of acculturation in context with cognition. Methods and Results Acculturation in context data from 192 Latino participants without dementia at baseline (age ~70 years) were compiled into 3 separate composite scores: acculturation-related (nativity, language-, and social-based preferences), contextually related socioenvironmental (experiences of discrimination, social isolation, social networks), and familism-related (Latino-centric family ethos). A modified American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (mLS7; ie, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, blood glucose) was used to measure cardiovascular health. Mixed effects regressions simultaneously tested the association of all 3 composite scores with total mLS7 adjusting for confounders. Separate models tested whether mLS7 modified associations of the 3 composite scores and cognition. The contextually related socioenvironmental composite score reflecting higher discrimination, higher social isolation, and smaller social networks (estimate=0.22, SE=0.10, P=0.02) and the familism score (estimate=0.16, SE=0.07, P=0.02) both significantly associated with change in total mLS7. The acculturation-related composite was not significantly associated with change in mLS7. No composite was significantly associated with level of mLS7.

Here, we investigate the function of ZCCHC17 and its role in AD pathogenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation of ZCCHC17 followed by mass spectrometry analysis in human iPSC-derived neurons reveals that ZCCHC17's binding partners are enriched for RNA splicing proteins. ZCCHC17 knockdown results in widespread RNA splicing changes that significantly overlap with splicing changes found in AD brain tissue, with synaptic genes commonly affected. ZCCHC17 expression correlates with cognitive resilience in AD patients, and we uncover an APOE4 dependent negative correlation of ZCCHC17 expression with tangle burden. Furthermore, a majority of ZCCHC17 interactors also co-IP with known tau interactors, and we find significant overlap between alternatively spliced genes in ZCCHC17 knockdown and tau overexpression neurons. These results demonstrate ZCCHC17's role in neuronal RNA processing and its interaction with pathology and cognitive resilience in AD, and suggest that maintenance of ZCCHC17 function may be a therapeutic strategy for preserving cognitive function in the setting of AD pathology. SIGNIFICANCE: Abnormal RNA processing is an important component of AD pathophysiology. We show here that ZCCHC17, a previously identified putative master regulator of synaptic dysfunction in AD, plays a role in neuronal RNA processing, and illustrate that ZCCHC17 dysfunction is sufficient to explain some of the splicing abnormalities seen in AD brain tissue, including synaptic gene splicing abnormalities. Using data from human patients, we demonstrate that ZCCHC17 mRNA levels correlate with cognitive resilience in the setting of AD pathology.

Here, we characterized the epigenetic factors, mainly DNA methylation, regulating PKMζ expression in the human brain. The PRKCZ gene has an upstream promoter regulating Protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ), and an internal promoter driving PKMζ expression. A demethylated region, including a canonical CREB binding site, situated at the internal promoter was only observed in human CNS tissues. The induction of site-specific hypermethylation of this region resulted in decreased CREB1 binding and downregulation of PKMζ expression. Noteworthy, CREB binding sites were absent in the upstream promoter of PRKCZ locus, suggesting a specific mechanism for regulating PKMζ expression. These observations were validated using a system of human neuronal differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). CREB1 binding at the internal promoter was detected only in differentiated neurons, where PKMζ is expressed. The same epigenetic mechanism in the context of CREB binding site was identified in other genes involved in neuronal differentiation and LTP. Additionally, aberrant DNA hypermethylation at the internal promoter was observed in cases of Alzheimer's disease, correlating with decreased expression of PKMζ in patient brains. Altogether, we present a conserved epigenetic mechanism regulating PKMζ expression and other genes enhanced in the CNS with possible implications in neuronal differentiation and Alzheimer's disease.",2023-03,194909,Biochim Biophys Acta Gene Regul Mech,PubMed,PMID: 36682583 PMCID: PMC10037092,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36682583,"Humans; Alzheimer's disease; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; CREB1; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; DNA methylation; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenetics; Long-Term Potentiation; PKMζ",

To better understand microglia-mediated processes in AD, we studied the function of INPP5D/SHIP1, a gene linked to AD through GWAS. Immunostaining and single nucleus RNA sequencing confirmed that INPP5D expression in the adult human brain is largely restricted to microglia. Examination of prefrontal cortex across a large cohort revealed reduced full length INPP5D protein levels in AD patient brains compared to cognitively normal controls. The functional consequences of reduced INPP5D activity were evaluated in human induced pluripotent stem cell derived microglia (iMGLs), using both pharmacological inhibition of the phosphatase activity of INPP5D and genetic reduction in copy number. Unbiased transcriptional and proteomic profiling of iMGLs suggested an upregulation of innate immune signaling pathways, lower levels of scavenger receptors, and altered inflammasome signaling with INPP5D reduction. INPP5D inhibition induced the secretion of IL-1ß and IL-18, further implicating inflammasome activation. Inflammasome activation was confirmed through visualization of inflammasome formation through ASC immunostaining in INPP5D-inhibited iMGLs, increased cleaved caspase-1 and through rescue of elevated IL-1ß and IL-18 with caspase-1 and NLRP3 inhibitors.

To interrogate the role(s) of SORL1 in human brain cells, SORL1 null iPSCs were generated, followed by differentiation to neuron, astrocyte, microglia, and endothelial cell fates. Loss of SORL1 led to alterations in both overlapping and distinct pathways across cell types, with the greatest effects in neurons and astrocytes. Intriguingly, SORL1 loss led to a dramatic neuron-specific reduction in APOE levels. Further, analyses of iPSCs derived from a human aging cohort revealed a neuron-specific linear correlation between SORL1 and APOE RNA and protein levels, a finding validated in human post-mortem brain. Pathway analysis implicated intracellular transport pathways and TGF- β/SMAD signaling in the function of SORL1 in neurons. In accord, enhancement of retromer-mediated trafficking and autophagy rescued elevated phospho-tau observed in SORL1 null neurons but did not rescue APOE levels, suggesting that these phenotypes are separable.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize trends in pathways underlying dementia by examining prevalence of postmortem neuropathologies in birth cohorts across 25 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two longitudinal cohorts, the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, with autopsy data from 1997 to 2022 with up to 27 years follow-up were analyzed. Deceased individuals with complete postmortem neuropathology evaluations were included, and 177 individuals with most distant (<1905) or recent (>1930) years of birth were excluded. EXPOSURES: Four categories of year of birth: 1905-1914, 1915-1919, 1920-1924, and 1925-1930. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), global AD pathology, amyloid load, tau tangles, neocortical Lewy bodies, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological change, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, gross chronic infarcts, and chronic microinfarcts. For comparison, pathologies in each birth epoch were age-standardized to age distribution of the cohorts. χ2 Tests were used for categorical outcomes, and analysis of variance was used to compare means across birth epochs. RESULTS: Overall, 1554 participants were examined (510 [33%] male; median [range] age at death, 90 [66-108] years). Participants were distributed fairly evenly across birth epochs (1905-1914: n = 374; 1915-1919: n = 360; 1920-1924: n = 466; 1925-1930: n = 354). Across year of birth groups, no differences were found in prevalence of pathologic AD diagnosis; age-standardized prevalence fluctuated between 62% and 68% in the birth cohorts (χ2 test: P = .76 across birth epochs). Similarly, no differences were found in mean levels of global AD pathology, although there was greater density specifically of tau tangles in later birth cohorts (eg, age-standardized mean [SD], 1.53 [1.20] years for the 1905-1914 cohort and 1.87 [1.47] years for the 1925-1930 cohort; analysis of variance test: P = .01 across birth cohorts). There were no differences over time in other neurodegenerative pathologies. In contrast, atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis were dramatically lower over time; for example, age-standardized prevalence of moderate to severe atherosclerosis ranged from 54% among those born from 1905-1914 to 22% for 1925-1930 (χ2 test: P < .001 across birth epochs). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this study, few differences in neurodegenerative pathologies were found, but there may be worse levels of tau tangles across birth cohorts over 25 years. This indicates that any improvements over time in clinical dementia observed by cohorts are likely in part associated with improved resilience to pathology rather than reduced AD pathology. Finally, vessel pathologies were markedly lower over birth cohorts, indicating the assocation with brain health of populationwide improvements in several vascular risk factors.",01/04/2023,370-376,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 36805154 PMCID: PMC9941972,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36805154,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Infant; Atherosclerosis; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Nervous System Diseases; Autopsy",

Here we assess the effect of loneliness and change in loneliness on CR at end of life and across older adulthood. METHODS: Data were combined from 2 longitudinal studies of older adults. CR proximate to death (CRlast_level) and across time (CRslope) was obtained by independently regressing global cognition and change in cognition onto multiple neuropathology indicators and extracting the resulting residuals. We used a series of simple linear regression models to assess the effect of loneliness level and change on CRlast_level and CRslope. RESULTS: Higher baseline loneliness was associated with lower CRlast_level (β = -0.11, 95% confidence interval [95% CI; -0.18, -0.04], p < .01); higher baseline loneliness and increasing loneliness over time was associated with lower CRslope (β = -0.13, 95% CI [-0.22, -0.05], p < .01 and β = -0.12, 95% CI [-0.20, -0.04], p < .01, respectively). Results were robust to covariate inclusion and independent of objective social isolation. DISCUSSION: Higher and increasing loneliness was associated with lower CR in the face of neuropathology.

Compared to circulating immune cells (n=389), post-mitotic brain tissue (n=798) contained more Numts, consistent with their potential somatic accumulation. Within brain samples we observed a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to cerebellum samples, suggesting that brain Numts arose spontaneously during development or across the lifespan. Moreover, more brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts using a repeatedmeasures WGS design in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular hallmarks of aging. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of one Numt every ~13 days. Numtogenesis was independent of large-scale genomic instability and unlikely driven cell clonality. Targeted pharmacological perturbations including chronic glucocorticoid signaling or impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) only modestly increased the rate of numtogenesis, whereas patient-derived SURF1-mutant cells exhibiting mtDNA instability accumulated Numts 4.7-fold faster than healthy donors.

Postmortem pathologic assessment included examination of 3 AD (amyloid-β and tau tangles determined by immunohistochemistry, and a global AD pathology score derived from diffuse and neurotic plaques and neurofibrillary tangle count) and 8 non-AD pathology indices. ER molecular genomic variants included genotyping and examining ER DNA methylation and RNA expression in brain regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) that are major players in cognition and often have AD pathology. RESULTS: The mean age of women (N = 1711) at baseline was 78.0 (SD = 7.7) years. In women, GPER1 molecular variants had the most consistent associations with AD traits.

For example, for Theme Three, older Black adults indicated that they would expect compensation for PET brain scan participation. Conversely, older Latinos stated that they would appreciate, but not anticipate, a financial incentive. All participants stressed the importance of written educational materials with subsequent verbal discussions with studystaff.

We used causal mediation methods to characterize pathways linking the APOE genotype to late-life cognition through Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD neuropathologies. METHODS: We analyzed autopsy data from 1671 individuals from the Religious Orders Study, Memory and Aging Project, and Minority Aging Research Study (ROS/MAP/MARS) studies with cognitive assessment within 5 years of death and autopsy measures of AD (amyloid beta (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles), vascular (athero/arteriolo-sclerosis, micro-infarcts/macro-infarcts), and non-AD neurodegenerative neuropathologies (TAR DNA protein 43 [TDP-43], Lewy bodies, amyloid angiopathy, hippocampal sclerosis). RESULTS: The detrimental effect of APOE ε4 on cognition was mediated by summary measures of AD and non-AD neurodegenerative neuropathologies but not vascular neuropathologies; effects were strongest in individuals with dementia. The protective effect of APOE ε2 was partly mediated by AD neuropathology and stronger in women than in men. DISCUSSION: The APOE genotype influences cognition and dementia through multiple neuropathological pathways, with implications for different therapeutic strategies targeting people at increased risk for dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Both apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2 and APOE ε4 effects on late-life cognition are mediated by AD neuropathology. The estimated mediated effects of most measures of AD neuropathology were similar. Non-Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurodegenerative pathologies mediate the effect of ε4 independently from AD.

METHODS: We used RNA-seq to quantify the prefrontal cortex expression of a panel of human activated astrocyte marker genes in 1076 older adults in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, 411 of whom had multi-day actigraphy prior to death. We related this to rest fragmentation, a proxy for sleep fragmentation, and to longitudinal cognitive function. RESULTS: Fragmentation of rest periods was associated with higher expression of activated astrocyte marker genes, which was associated with a lower level and faster decline of cognitive function. DISCUSSION: Astrocyte activation and fragmented rest are associated with each other and with accelerated cognitive decline. If experimental studies confirm a causal relationship, targeting sleep fragmentation and astrocyte activation may benefit cognition in older adults. HIGHLIGHTS: Greater fragmentation of rest periods, a proxy for sleep fragmentation, is associated with higher composite expression of a panel of genes characteristic of activated astrocytes. Increased expression of genes characteristic of activated astrocytes was associated with a lower level and more rapid decline of cognitive function, beyond that accounted for by the burden of amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle pathology.

As most insulin is secreted in the bloodstream by the pancreas, its capacity to regulate brain functions must, at least partly, be mediated through the cerebral vasculature. However, how insulin interacts with the blood-brain barrier and whether alterations of this interaction could contribute to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology both remain poorly defined. Here, we show that human and murine cerebral insulin receptors (INSRs), particularly the long isoform INSRα-B, are concentrated in microvessels rather than in the parenchyma. Vascular concentrations of INSRα-B were lower in the parietal cortex of subjects diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, positively correlating with cognitive scores, leading to a shift towards a higher INSRα-A/B ratio, consistent with cerebrovascular insulin resistance in the Alzheimer's disease brain. Vascular INSRα was inversely correlated with amyloid-β plaques and β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, but positively correlated with insulin-degrading enzyme, neprilysin and P-glycoprotein. Using brain cerebral intracarotid perfusion, we found that the transport rate of insulin across the blood-brain barrier remained very low (<0.03 µl/g·s) and was not inhibited by an insulin receptor antagonist. However, intracarotid perfusion of insulin induced the phosphorylation of INSRβ that was restricted to microvessels. Such an activation of vascular insulin receptor was blunted in 3xTg-AD mice, suggesting that Alzheimer's disease neuropathology induces insulin resistance at the level of the blood-brain barrier. Overall, the present data in post-mortem Alzheimer's disease brains and an animal model of Alzheimer's disease indicate that defects in the insulin receptor localized at the blood-brain barrier strongly contribute to brain insulin resistance in Alzheimer's disease, in association with β-amyloid pathology.",05/01/2023,75-90,Brain,PubMed,PMID: 36280236 PMCID: PMC9897197,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36280236,"Alzheimer’s disease; Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Mice; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; blood–brain barrier; Disease Models, Animal; Insulin; insulin receptor; insulin resistance; Insulin Resistance; Receptor, Insulin",

The current study examines longitudinal change in serial position scores as markers of subtle cognitive decline in older adults who may be in preclinical or at-risk states for AD. METHODS: This study uses longitudinal data from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Participants (n = 141) were included if they did not have dementia at enrollment, completed follow-up assessments, and died and were classified as Braak stage I or II. Memory tests were used to calculate serial position (primacy, recency), total recall, and episodic memory composite scores. A neuropathological evaluation quantified AD, vascular, and Lewy body pathologies. Mixed effects models were used to examine change in memory scores. Neuropathologies and covariates (age, sex, education, APOE e4) were examined as moderators. RESULTS: Primacy scores declined (β = -.032, p < .001), whereas recency scores increased (β = .021, p = .012). No change was observed in standard memory measures. Greater neurofibrillary tangle density and atherosclerosis explained 10.4% of the variance in primacy decline. Neuropathologies were not associated with recency change. CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with hippocampal neuropathologies, primacy score decline may be a sensitive marker of early AD-related changes. Tangle density and atherosclerosis had additive effects on decline. Recency improvement may reflect a compensatory mechanism.

This study examined the influence of APOE genotypes on blood and brain markers of the L-carnitine system, necessary for fatty acid oxidation (FAO), and their collective influence on the clinical and pathological outcomes of AD. METHODS: L-carnitine, its metabolites γ-butyrobetaine (GBB) and trimethylamine-n-oxide (TMAO), and its esters (acylcarnitines) were analyzed in blood from predominantly White community/clinic-based individuals (n = 372) and in plasma and brain from the Religious Order Study (ROS) (n = 79) using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). FINDINGS: Relative to total blood acylcarnitines, levels of short chain acylcarnitines (SCAs) were higher whereas long chain acylcarnitines (LCAs) were lower in AD, which was observed pre-clinically in APOE ε4s. Plasma medium chain acylcarnitines (MCAs) were higher amongst cognitively healthy APOE ε2 carriers relative to other genotypes. Compared to their respective controls, elevated TMAO and lower L-carnitine and GBB were associated with AD clinical diagnosis and these differences were detected preclinically among APOE ε4 carriers. Plasma and brain GBB, TMAO, and acylcarnitines were also associated with post-mortem brain amyloid, tau, and cerebrovascular pathologies. INTERPRETATION: Alterations in blood L-carnitine, GBB, TMAO, and acylcarnitines occur early in clinical AD progression and are influenced by APOE genotype.

METHODS: We developed immunoassays specifically detecting all C-terminal variants of secreted amyloid β-protein and identified a novel biomarker, the Aβ 37/42 ratio, that outperforms the canonical Aβ42/40 ratio as a means to evaluate the γ-secretase activity and brain Aβ accumulation. RESULTS: We show that Aβ 37/42 can distinguish physiological and pathological status in (1) presenilin-1 mutant vs wild-type cultured cells, (2) AD vs control brain tissue, and (3) AD versus cognitively normal (CN) subjects in CSF, where 37/42 (AUC 0.9622) outperformed 42/40 (AUC 0.8651) in distinguishing CN from AD. DISCUSSION: We conclude that the Aβ 37/42 ratio sensitively detects presenilin/γ-secretase dysfunction and better distinguishes CN from AD than Aβ42/40 in CSF. Measuring this novel ratio alongside promising phospho-tau analytes may provide highly discriminatory fluid biomarkers for AD.",2023-01,79-96,Alzheimers Dement,PubMed,PMID: 35278341 PMCID: PMC9464800,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35278341,Humans; Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Peptide Fragments; Biomarkers; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; amyloid β-protein; CSF biomarkers,
