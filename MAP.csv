Human restricted CHRFAM7A has been associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. METHODS: The physiological role of CHRFAM7A in human brain is explored using multiomics approach on 600 post mortem human brain tissue samples. The emerging pathways and mechanistic hypotheses are tested and validated in an isogenic hiPSC model of CHRFAM7A knock-in medial ganglionic eminence progenitors and neurons. FINDINGS: CHRFAM7A is identified as a modulator of intracellular calcium dynamics and an upstream regulator of Rac1. Rac1 activation re-designs the actin cytoskeleton leading to dynamic actin driven remodeling of membrane protrusion and a switch from filopodia to lamellipodia. The reinforced cytoskeleton leads to an advantage to tolerate stiffer mechanical properties of the extracellular environment. INTERPRETATION: CHRFAM7A modifies the actin cytoskeleton to a more dynamic and stiffness resistant state in an α7nAChR dependent manner. CHRFAM7A may facilitate neuronal adaptation to changes in the brain environment in physiological and pathological conditions contributing to risk or recovery. Understanding how CHRFAM7A affects human brain requires human studies in the areas of memory formation and erasure, cognitive reserve, and neuronal plasticity.

To uncover the molecular basis of human brain connectivity, we analyzed a unique cohort of 98 individuals who provided neuroimaging and genetic data contemporaneous with dendritic spine morphometric, proteomic, and gene expression data from the superior frontal and inferior temporal gyri. Through cellular contextualization of the molecular data with dendritic spine morphology, we identified hundreds of proteins related to synapses, energy metabolism, and RNA processing that explain between-individual differences in functional connectivity and structural covariation. By integrating data at the genetic, molecular, subcellular, and tissue levels, we bridged the divergent fields of molecular biology and neuroimaging to identify a molecular basis of brain connectivity.

We investigated associations of AD-CT and WMH volumes with a composite index of health and financial literacy given that the ability to access, understand, and utilize health and financial information significantly influences older adults' health outcomes. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Participants were 303 adults without dementia (age∼80 years; 74% women) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. MEASUREMENTS: Baseline 3T MRI T1-weighted structural and T2-weighted FLAIR data were used to assess AD-CT and WMH volumes, respectively. Literacy was measured using questions designed to assess comprehension of health and financial information and concepts, yielding a total literacy score. Multivariable linear mixed effects regression models determined the relationship of each neuroimaging marker, first separately and then combined, with the level of and change in literacy.

To extend the biomarker literature, associations between serial position scores and postmortem levels of brain phosphorylated tau (p-tau) were examined, in the context of Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangle progression. METHOD: Participants were 1091 community-dwelling adults (Mage = 80.2, 68.9% female) from the Rush University Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project who were non-demented at enrollment and followed for a mean of 9.2 years until death. The CERAD Word List Memory test administered at baseline and within 1 year of death was used to calculate serial position (primacy, recency) and total recall scores. Proteomic analyses quantified p-tau 217 and 202 from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples. Linear regressions assessed associations between cognitive scores and p-tau with Braak stage as a moderator. RESULTS: Cognitive status proximal to death indicated 34.7% were unimpaired, 26.2% met criteria for MCI, and 39.0% for dementia. Better baseline primacy recall, but not recency recall, was associated with lower p-tau 217 levels across Braak stages. Delayed recall showed a similar pattern as primacy. There was no main effect of immediate recall, but an interaction with Braak stages indicated a negative association with p-tau 217 level only in Braak V-VI. Within 1 year of death, there were no main effects for cognitive scores; however, recency, immediate and delayed recall scores interacted with Braak stage showing better recall was associated with lower p-tau 217 only in Braak V-VI. No associations were observed with p-tau 202. CONCLUSIONS: Primacy recall measured in non-demented adults may be sensitive to emergent tau phosphorylation that occurs in the earliest stages of AD.

However, direct observation of microglia in living people is not currently possible. Here, we indexed the heritable propensity for neuroinflammation with polygenic risk scores (PRS), using results from a recent genome-wide analysis of a validated post-mortem measure of morphological microglial activation. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether a PRS for microglial activation (PRSmic) could augment the predictive performance of existing AD PRSs for late-life cognitive impairment. METHODS: First, PRSmic were calculated and optimized in a calibration cohort (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), n = 450), with resampling. Second, predictive performance of optimal PRSmic was assessed in two independent, population-based cohorts (total n = 212,237). Finally, we explored associations of PRSmic with a comprehensive set of imaging and fluid AD biomarkers in ADNI. RESULTS: Our PRSmic showed no significant improvement in predictive power for either AD diagnosis or cognitive performance in either external cohort. Some nominal associations were found in ADNI, but with inconsistent effect directions. CONCLUSION: While genetic scores capable of indexing risk for neuroinflammatory processes in aging are highly desirable, more well-powered genome-wide studies of microglial activation are required. Further, biobank-scale studies would benefit from phenotyping of proximal neuroinflammatory processes to improve the PRS development phase.",10/07/2023,,J Alzheimers Dis,PubMed,PMID: 37458040,,Alzheimer’s disease; neuroinflammation; Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging; computational modelling; microglial cell; polygenic traits; statistical data analysis,

As an approach to mechanistic discovery, we investigated whether MIND diet (Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), a consistent risk factor for dementia, is correlated with a specific profile of cortical gene expression, and whether such a transcriptomic profile is associated with dementia, in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted in postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue from 1,204 deceased participants; neuropsychological assessments were performed annually prior to death. In a subset of 482 participants, diet was assessed ~6 years before death using a validated food-frequency questionnaire; in these participants, using elastic net regression, we identified a transcriptomic profile, consisting of 50 genes, significantly correlated with MIND diet score ( P =0.001).

For APOE ε4, a robust sex interaction was observed on baseline memory (β = -0.071, SE = 0.014; P = 9.6 × 10-7), whereby the APOE ε4 negative effect was stronger in females compared with males and did not significantly differ among races. Contrastingly, despite the large sample size, no APOE ε2 × sex interactions on cognition were observed among all participants. When testing for intersectional effects of sex, APOE ε2, and race, an interaction was revealed on baseline executive function among individuals who were cognitively unimpaired (β = -0.165, SE = 0.066; P = .01), whereby the APOE ε2 protective effect was female-specific among White individuals but male-specific among Black individuals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, while race did not modify sex differences in APOE ε4, the APOE ε2 protective effect could vary by race and sex. Although female sex enhanced ε4-associated risk, there was no comparable sex difference in ε2, suggesting biological pathways underlying ε4-associated risk are distinct from ε2 and likely intersect with age-related changes in sex biology.",17/07/2023,e232169,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 37459083 PMCID: PMC10352930,,,

We investigated whether the two pathologies act synergistically to further potentiate the severity of parkinsonism beyond their separate effects. METHODS: We employed postmortem data of decedents from 3 longitudinal community-based studies of aging who underwent annual clinical evaluation to assess parkinsonian signs using 26-items of the motor portion of a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. A summary score was developed from each item score to construct a global parkinsonian score, with a higher score indicating more severe parkinsonism. A detailed neuropathologic evaluation was performed to identify LB, AD pathology, nigral neuronal loss, atherosclerosis, macroscopic infarcts, and other CVD pathologies (arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and microscopic infarcts). A series of regression models with terms for LB, CVD pathology, and the interaction of LB with CVD pathologies was fit for global parkinsonism proximate- to-death and for individual parkinsonian signs scores including, parkinsonian gait, rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. RESULTS: In 1,753 participants (mean age at death=89 years; 68% women), LB was observed in 26% of participants and CVD pathologies were present in more than two thirds of participants. LB and three CVD pathologies (atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and macroscopic infarcts) were each independently associated with the severity of global parkinsonism proximate-to-death (LB: β=0.318, SE=0.08, p=<0.001, atherosclerosis: β=0.373, SE=0.079, p=<0.001, arteriolosclerosis: β=0.253, SE=0.078, p=0.001, macroscopic infarcts: β=0.333, SE=0.077, p=<0.001). A linear regression model adjusted for demographics, CVD, and neurodegenerative pathologies showed interaction between LB and macroscopic infarcts (β=0.463, SE=0.168, p=0.006), with LBs being associated with worse global parkinsonism when macroinfarcts are present. Similar interactions were found for atherosclerosis and LBs (β=0.371, SE=0.173, p=0.032) as well as for parkinsonian gait as the outcome (macroscopic infarcts: β=0.662, SE=0.239, p=0.005; atherosclerosis: β=0.509, SE=0.246, p=0.038). Findings were not affected when the 66 participants with a clinical diagnosis of PD were excluded. In contrast, there were no interactions between LB and other CVD pathologies or between atherosclerosis and macroscopic infarcts for global parkinsonism proximate-to-death. DISCUSSION: These findings suggest that atherosclerosis and macroscopic infarcts interact with LB pathology to increase the severity of parkinsonism beyond their additive effects in older persons.",12/07/2023,10.1212/WNL.0000000000207497,Neurology,PubMed,PMID: 37438127,,atherosclerosis; cerebrovascular disease; gait problem; infarcts; Lewy body; parkinsonism,

Identifying the biological factors and pathways that contribute to chronic inflammation is crucial for developing new therapeutic targets. Circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) has been proposed as an immune stimulator and potential predictor of mortality in acute illnesses. Dementia and frailty are both associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired cellular energetics, and cell death. The size and abundance of ccf-mtDNA fragments may indicate the mechanism of cell death: long fragments typically result from necrosis, while short fragments arise from apoptosis. We hypothesize that increased levels of necrosis-associated long ccf-mtDNA fragments and inflammatory markers in serum are linked to declines in cognitive and physical function, as well as increased mortality risk. RESULTS: Our study of 672 community-dwelling older adults revealed that inflammatory markers (C-Reactive Protein, soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha, tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor 1 [sTNFR1], and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) positively correlated with ccf-mtDNA levels in serum. Although cross-sectional analysis revealed no significant associations between short and long ccf-mtDNA fragments, longitudinal analysis demonstrated a connection between higher long ccf-mtDNA fragments (necrosis-associated) and worsening composite gait scores over time. Additionally, increased mortality risk was observed only in individuals with elevated sTNFR1 levels. CONCLUSION: In a community dwelling cohort of older adults, there are cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between ccf-mtDNA and sTNFR1 with impaired physical and cognitive function and increased hazard of death.

The cell-type specific and, separately, peptide specific associations of VGF with pathologic and cognitive outcomes remain largely unknown. We leveraged gene expression and protein data from the human neocortex and investigated the VGF associations with common neuropathologies and late-life cognitive decline. METHODS: Community-dwelling older adults were followed every year, died, and underwent brain autopsy. Cognitive decline was captured via annual cognitive testing. Common neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular conditions were assessed during neuropathologic evaluations. Bulk brain RNASeq and targeted proteomics analyses were conducted using frozen tissues from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 1,020 individuals. Cell-type specific gene expressions were quantified in a subsample (N = 424) following single nuclei RNASeq analysis from the same cortex. RESULTS: The bulk brain VGF gene expression was primarily associated with AD and Lewy bodies. The VGF gene association with cognitive decline was in part accounted for by neuropathologies. Similar associations were observed for the VGF protein. Cell-type specific analyses revealed that, while VGF was differentially expressed in most major cell types in the cortex, its association with neuropathologies and cognitive decline was restricted to the neuronal cells. Further, the peptide fragments across the VGF polypeptide resembled each other in relation to neuropathologies and cognitive decline. INTERPRETATION: Multiple pathways link VGF to cognitive health in older age, including neurodegeneration. The VGF gene functions primarily in neuronal cells and its protein associations with pathologic and cognitive outcomes do not map to a specific peptide.

Participants died and underwent brain autopsy. P-tau181 and p-tau217 were quantified in the plasma samples proximate to death (average interval before death: 1.4 years) using Lilly-developed MSD immunoassays. Uniform neuropathologic evaluations assessed AD, PART, and other common degenerative and cerebrovascular conditions. Plasma p-tau217 was more strongly correlated with brain β-amyloid and paired helical filament tau (PHFtau) tangles than p-tau181. Both p-tau markers were associated with greater odds of AD, but p-tau217 had higher accuracy (area under the ROC curve (AUC): 0.83) than p-tau181 (AUC: 0.76).

Taking advantage of recent developments in ultra-high field (7 T) imaging, we investigated whether imaging measures of the LC also reveal a specific anatomic correlation with tau using novel plasma biomarkers of different species of hyperphosphorylated tau, how early in adulthood these associations can be detected and if are associated with worse cognitive performance. To validate the anatomic correlations, we tested if a rostro-caudal gradient in tau pathology is also detected at autopsy in data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). We found that higher plasma measures of phosphorylated tau, in particular ptau231, correlated negatively with dorso-rostral LC integrity, whereas correlations for neurodegenerative plasma markers (neurofilament light, total tau) were scattered throughout the LC including middle to caudal sections. In contrast, the plasma Aβ42/40 ratio, associated with brain amyloidosis, did not correlate with LC integrity. These findings were specific to the rostral LC and not observed when using the entire LC or the hippocampus. Furthermore, in the MAP data, we observed higher rostral than caudal tangle density in the LC, independent of the disease stage. The in vivo LC-phosphorylated tau correlations became significant from midlife, with the earliest effect for ptau231, starting at about age 55. Finally, interactions between lower rostral LC integrity and higher ptau231 concentrations predicted lower cognitive performance.

These cognitively normal people with AD pathology are described as preclinical or asymptomatic AD (AsymAD) and appear to exhibit cognitive resilience to the clinical manifestations of AD dementia. Here we present a comprehensive network-based approach from cases clinically and pathologically defined as asymptomatic AD to map resilience-associated pathways and extend mechanistic validation. Multiplex tandem mass tag MS (TMT-MS) proteomic data (n = 7787 proteins) was generated on brain tissue from Brodmann area 6 and Brodmann area 37 (n = 109 cases, n = 218 total samples) and evaluated by consensus weighted gene correlation network analysis. Notably, neuritin (NRN1), a neurotrophic factor previously linked to cognitive resilience, was identified as a hub protein in a module associated with synaptic biology. To validate the function of NRN1 with regard to the neurobiology of AD, we conducted microscopy and physiology experiments in a cellular model of AD. NRN1 provided dendritic spine resilience against amyloid-β (Aβ) and blocked Aβ-induced neuronal hyperexcitability in cultured neurons. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of resilience to Aβ provided by NRN1, we assessed how exogenous NRN1 alters the proteome by TMT-MS (n = 8238 proteins) of cultured neurons and integrated the results with the AD brain network. This revealed overlapping synapse-related biology that linked NRN1-induced changes in cultured neurons with human pathways associated with cognitive resilience.

However, our limited understanding of the biological basis of depression has hindered the development of novel treatments and interventions. METHODS: To identify new candidate genes for therapeutic development, we examined single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snucRNAseq) data from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (N=424) in relation to ante-mortem depressive symptoms. To complement these direct analyses, we also used genome- wide association study (GWAS) results for depression (N=500,199) along with genetic tools for inferring the expression of 22,159 genes in 7 cell types and 55 cell subtypes to perform transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) of depression followed by Mendelian randomization (MR). RESULTS: Our single-nucleus TWAS analysis identified 71 causal genes in depression that have a role in specific neocortical cell subtypes; 59 of 71 genes were novel compared to previous studies. Depression TWAS genes showed a cell type specific pattern, with the greatest enrichment being in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons as well as astrocytes. Gene expression in different neuron subtypes have different directions of effect on depression risk. Compared to lower genetically correlated traits (e.g. body mass index) with depression, higher correlated traits (e.g., neuroticism) have more common TWAS genes with depression. In parallel, we performed differential gene expression analysis in relation to depression in 55 cortical cell subtypes, and we found that genes such as ANKRD36 , MADD , TAOK3 , SCAI and CHUK are associated with depression in specific cell subtypes.

PRS was calculated in using clumping/thresholding and Bayesian methods and was assessed for association with Alzheimer's disease and age at onset. Penetrance and recurrence risk for carriers in highest and lowest PRS quintiles were compared separately within APOE-ε4 carriers and non-carriers. RESULTS: PRS excluding the APOE region was strongly associated with clinical and neuropathological diagnosis of AD.

Here, we investigate the function of ZCCHC17 and its role in AD pathogenesis. Co-immunoprecipitation of ZCCHC17 followed by mass spectrometry analysis in human iPSC-derived neurons reveals that ZCCHC17's binding partners are enriched for RNA splicing proteins. ZCCHC17 knockdown results in widespread RNA splicing changes that significantly overlap with splicing changes found in AD brain tissue, with synaptic genes commonly affected. ZCCHC17 expression correlates with cognitive resilience in AD patients, and we uncover an APOE4 dependent negative correlation of ZCCHC17 expression with tangle burden. Furthermore, a majority of ZCCHC17 interactors also co-IP with known tau interactors, and we find significant overlap between alternatively spliced genes in ZCCHC17 knockdown and tau overexpression neurons. These results demonstrate ZCCHC17's role in neuronal RNA processing and its interaction with pathology and cognitive resilience in AD, and suggest that maintenance of ZCCHC17 function may be a therapeutic strategy for preserving cognitive function in the setting of AD pathology. SIGNIFICANCE: Abnormal RNA processing is an important component of AD pathophysiology. We show here that ZCCHC17, a previously identified putative master regulator of synaptic dysfunction in AD, plays a role in neuronal RNA processing, and illustrate that ZCCHC17 dysfunction is sufficient to explain some of the splicing abnormalities seen in AD brain tissue, including synaptic gene splicing abnormalities. Using data from human patients, we demonstrate that ZCCHC17 mRNA levels correlate with cognitive resilience in the setting of AD pathology. These results suggest that maintenance of ZCCHC17 function may be a therapeutic strategy for supporting cognitive function in AD patients, and motivate future work examining a possible role of abnormal RNA processing in AD-related cognitive decline.",21/03/2023,2023.03.21.533654,bioRxiv,PubMed,PMID: 36993746 PMCID: PMC10055234,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36993746,,

Methods and Results Acculturation in context data from 192 Latino participants without dementia at baseline (age ~70 years) were compiled into 3 separate composite scores: acculturation-related (nativity, language-, and social-based preferences), contextually related socioenvironmental (experiences of discrimination, social isolation, social networks), and familism-related (Latino-centric family ethos). A modified American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 (mLS7; ie, smoking, physical activity, body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, blood glucose) was used to measure cardiovascular health. Mixed effects regressions simultaneously tested the association of all 3 composite scores with total mLS7 adjusting for confounders.

Longitudinal epidemiologic studies have observed heterogeneity in the brain and cognitive aging. Brain resilience was described as above-expected cognitive function. The ""resilience"" framework has been shown to correlate with individual characteristics such as genetic factors and age. Besides, accumulative evidence has confirmed the association of mitochondria with the pathogenesis of AD. However, it is challenging to assess resilience through genetic metrics, in particular incorporating mitochondria-associated loci. OBJECTIVES: In this paper, we first demonstrated that polygenic risk scores (PRS) could characterize individuals' resilience levels. Then, we indicated that mitochondria-associated loci could improve the performance of PRSs, providing more reliable measurements for the prevention and diagnosis of AD. METHODS: The discovery (N = 1,550) and independent validation samples (N = 2,090) were used to construct nine types of PRSs containing mitochondria-related loci (PRSMT) from both biological and statistical aspects and combined them with known AD risk loci derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS).Individuals' levels of brain resilience were comprehensively measured by linear regression models using eight pathological characteristics. RESULTS: It was found that PRSs could characterize brain resilience levels (e.g., Pearson correlation test Pmin = 7.96×10-9). Moreover, the performance of PRS models could be efficiently improved by incorporating a small number of mitochondria-related loci (e.g., Pearson correlation test P improved from 1.41×10-3 to 6.09×10-6). PRSs' ability to characterize brain resilience was validated. More importantly, by incorporating some mitochondria-related loci, the performance of PRSs in measuring brain resilience could be significantly improved.

We associated glial, vascular and neuronal subpopulations with AD-related traits for 424 aging individuals, and aligned them along the disease cascade using causal modeling. We identified two distinct lipid-associated microglial subpopulations, one contributed to amyloid-β proteinopathy while the other mediated the effect of amyloid-β in accelerating tau proteinopathy, as well as an astrocyte subpopulation that mediated the effect of tau on cognitive decline. To model the coordinated dynamics of the entire cellular environment we devised the BEYOND methodology which uncovered two distinct trajectories of brain aging that are defined by distinct sequences of changes in cellular communities. Older individuals are engaged in one of two possible trajectories, each associated with progressive changes in specific cellular communities that end with: (1) AD dementia or (2) alternative brain aging.

METHODS: Autopsied participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project with complete dietary information (collected through a validated food frequency questionnaire) and AD pathology data (β-amyloid load, phosphorylated tau tangles, and global AD pathology [summarized neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic and diffuse plaques]) were included in this study.

At annual intervals thereafter, they completed 6 tests of decision making. RESULTS: In a factor analysis of baseline decision making scores, 3 measures (financial/health literacy, financial/health decision making, scam susceptibility) loaded on an ""analytic"" factor and 3 (temporal discounting small stakes, temporal discounting large stakes, risk aversion) loaded on a ""preferences"" (for temporal discounting and avoiding risk) factor.

To interrogate the role(s) of SORL1 in human brain cells, SORL1 null iPSCs were generated, followed by differentiation to neuron, astrocyte, microglia, and endothelial cell fates. Loss of SORL1 led to alterations in both overlapping and distinct pathways across cell types, with the greatest effects in neurons and astrocytes. Intriguingly, SORL1 loss led to a dramatic neuron-specific reduction in APOE levels. Further, analyses of iPSCs derived from a human aging cohort revealed a neuron-specific linear correlation between SORL1 and APOE RNA and protein levels, a finding validated in human post-mortem brain. Pathway analysis implicated intracellular transport pathways and TGF- β/SMAD signaling in the function of SORL1 in neurons.

RESULTS: We identified 270 distinct differentially methylated regions (DMRs) associated with AD. We quantified the impact of these DMRs on each gene and each protein as well as gene and protein co-expression networks. DNA methylation had a profound impact on both AD-associated gene/protein modules and their key regulators.

OBJECTIVE: To characterize trends in pathways underlying dementia by examining prevalence of postmortem neuropathologies in birth cohorts across 25 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Two longitudinal cohorts, the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, with autopsy data from 1997 to 2022 with up to 27 years follow-up were analyzed. Deceased individuals with complete postmortem neuropathology evaluations were included, and 177 individuals with most distant (<1905) or recent (>1930) years of birth were excluded. EXPOSURES: Four categories of year of birth: 1905-1914, 1915-1919, 1920-1924, and 1925-1930. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Outcomes included pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), global AD pathology, amyloid load, tau tangles, neocortical Lewy bodies, limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy neuropathological change, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, gross chronic infarcts, and chronic microinfarcts. For comparison, pathologies in each birth epoch were age-standardized to age distribution of the cohorts. χ2 Tests were used for categorical outcomes, and analysis of variance was used to compare means across birth epochs. RESULTS: Overall, 1554 participants were examined (510 [33%] male; median [range] age at death, 90 [66-108] years). Participants were distributed fairly evenly across birth epochs (1905-1914: n = 374; 1915-1919: n = 360; 1920-1924: n = 466; 1925-1930: n = 354). Across year of birth groups, no differences were found in prevalence of pathologic AD diagnosis; age-standardized prevalence fluctuated between 62% and 68% in the birth cohorts (χ2 test: P = .76 across birth epochs). Similarly, no differences were found in mean levels of global AD pathology, although there was greater density specifically of tau tangles in later birth cohorts (eg, age-standardized mean [SD], 1.53 [1.20] years for the 1905-1914 cohort and 1.87 [1.47] years for the 1925-1930 cohort; analysis of variance test: P = .01 across birth cohorts). There were no differences over time in other neurodegenerative pathologies. In contrast, atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis were dramatically lower over time; for example, age-standardized prevalence of moderate to severe atherosclerosis ranged from 54% among those born from 1905-1914 to 22% for 1925-1930 (χ2 test: P < .001 across birth epochs). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this study, few differences in neurodegenerative pathologies were found, but there may be worse levels of tau tangles across birth cohorts over 25 years. This indicates that any improvements over time in clinical dementia observed by cohorts are likely in part associated with improved resilience to pathology rather than reduced AD pathology. Finally, vessel pathologies were markedly lower over birth cohorts, indicating the assocation with brain health of populationwide improvements in several vascular risk factors.",01/04/2023,370-376,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 36805154 PMCID: PMC9941972,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36805154,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Infant; Atherosclerosis; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Nervous System Diseases; Autopsy",

Series B, Psychological Sciences and Social Sciences",1758-5368,10.1093/geronb/gbad023,"OBJECTIVES: Loneliness in the aging population is associated with decreased cognitive function and increased neuropathology; less is understood about the association of loneliness and cognitive resilience (CR), defined as the discordance between a person's actual and expected cognition given their neuropathology. Here we assess the effect of loneliness and change in loneliness on CR at end of life and across older adulthood. METHODS: Data were combined from 2 longitudinal studies of older adults. CR proximate to death (CRlast_level) and across time (CRslope) was obtained by independently regressing global cognition and change in cognition onto multiple neuropathology indicators and extracting the resulting residuals. We used a series of simple linear regression models to assess the effect of loneliness level and change on CRlast_level and CRslope. RESULTS: Higher baseline loneliness was associated with lower CRlast_level (β = -0.11, 95% confidence interval [95% CI; -0.18, -0.04], p < .01); higher baseline loneliness and increasing loneliness over time was associated with lower CRslope (β = -0.13, 95% CI [-0.22, -0.05], p < .01 and β = -0.12, 95% CI [-0.20, -0.04], p < .01, respectively). Results were robust to covariate inclusion and independent of objective social isolation. DISCUSSION: Higher and increasing loneliness was associated with lower CR in the face of neuropathology. These results suggest that some individuals are less resilient to the accumulation of neuropathology than others, and experiencing high/increasing loneliness is a key factor putting some at risk.

Here we investigated numtogenesis dynamics in humans in two ways. First, we quantified Numts in 1,187 postmortem brain and blood samples from different individuals. Compared to circulating immune cells (n=389), post-mitotic brain tissue (n=798) contained more Numts, consistent with their potential somatic accumulation. Within brain samples we observed a 5.5-fold enrichment of somatic Numt insertions in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex compared to cerebellum samples, suggesting that brain Numts arose spontaneously during development or across the lifespan. Moreover, more brain Numts was linked to earlier mortality. The brains of individuals with no cognitive impairment who died at younger ages carried approximately 2 more Numts per decade of life lost than those who lived longer. Second, we tested the dynamic transfer of Numts using a repeatedmeasures WGS design in a human fibroblast model that recapitulates several molecular hallmarks of aging. These longitudinal experiments revealed a gradual accumulation of one Numt every ~13 days. Numtogenesis was independent of large-scale genomic instability and unlikely driven cell clonality. Targeted pharmacological perturbations including chronic glucocorticoid signaling or impairing mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) only modestly increased the rate of numtogenesis, whereas patient-derived SURF1-mutant cells exhibiting mtDNA instability accumulated Numts 4.7-fold faster than healthy donors. Combined, our data document spontaneous 2 numtogenesis in human cells and demonstrate an association between brain cortical somatic Numts and human lifespan.

Postmortem pathologic assessment included examination of 3 AD (amyloid-β and tau tangles determined by immunohistochemistry, and a global AD pathology score derived from diffuse and neurotic plaques and neurofibrillary tangle count) and 8 non-AD pathology indices. ER molecular genomic variants included genotyping and examining ER DNA methylation and RNA expression in brain regions including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) that are major players in cognition and often have AD pathology. RESULTS: The mean age of women (N = 1711) at baseline was 78.0 (SD = 7.7) years. In women, GPER1 molecular variants had the most consistent associations with AD traits.

Here, we characterized the epigenetic factors, mainly DNA methylation, regulating PKMζ expression in the human brain. The PRKCZ gene has an upstream promoter regulating Protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ), and an internal promoter driving PKMζ expression. A demethylated region, including a canonical CREB binding site, situated at the internal promoter was only observed in human CNS tissues. The induction of site-specific hypermethylation of this region resulted in decreased CREB1 binding and downregulation of PKMζ expression. Noteworthy, CREB binding sites were absent in the upstream promoter of PRKCZ locus, suggesting a specific mechanism for regulating PKMζ expression. These observations were validated using a system of human neuronal differentiation from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). CREB1 binding at the internal promoter was detected only in differentiated neurons, where PKMζ is expressed. The same epigenetic mechanism in the context of CREB binding site was identified in other genes involved in neuronal differentiation and LTP. Additionally, aberrant DNA hypermethylation at the internal promoter was observed in cases of Alzheimer's disease, correlating with decreased expression of PKMζ in patient brains.

Tracking the earliest stages of the progression to dementia is paramount, and yet the importance of olfactory ability throughout cognitive states and death remains unclear. METHODS: Drawing data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (N = 1 501; 74% female), olfactory ability was assessed using the Brief Smell Identification Test (range = 0-16), while cognitive states (unimpaired, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], and dementia) were determined using a 3-step neuropsychological diagnostic protocol at up to 15 annual occasions. Multistate survival models simultaneously estimated the association of olfactory ability on transitions through cognitive states and death, while multinomial regression models estimated cognitively unimpaired and total life expectancies. RESULTS: Higher olfactory scores were associated with a reduced risk of transitioning from unimpaired cognition to MCI (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.82-0.88) and from MCI to dementia (HR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.86-0.93), indicating that 1-unit increase in olfactory scores was associated with an approximate 14% and 11% reduction in risk, respectively. Additionally, higher olfactory scores were associated with a greater likelihood of transitioning backward from MCI to unimpaired cognition (HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02-1.12). Furthermore, higher baseline olfactory scores were associated with more years of longevity without cognitive impairment. However, olfaction was not associated with the transition to death when accounting for transitions through cognitive states. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that higher olfactory identification scores are associated with a decreased risk of transitioning to impaired cognitive states and that associations between olfaction and mortality may occur primarily through the pathway of neurodegeneration.",08/07/2023,1284-1291,J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,PubMed,PMID: 36611276 PMCID: PMC10329218,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36611276,Alzheimer’s; Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Dementia; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuropsychological Tests; Olfaction Disorders; Smell; Life expectancy; Multistate survival modeling,

However, algorithm performance may be higher in cross-sectional settings, and this may impact estimates of risk factor associations. METHODS: We used data from the Religious Orders Study and the Memory and Aging Project (N = 3460) to assess the performance of example algorithms in classifying prevalent dementia in cross-sectional samples versus incident dementia in longitudinal samples. We used an applied example and simulation study to characterize the impact of varying sensitivity, specificity, and unequal sensitivity or specificity between exposure groups (differential performance) on estimated hazard ratios from Cox models. RESULTS: Using all items, algorithm sensitivity was higher for prevalent (0.796) versus incident dementia (0.719); hazard ratios had slight bias. Sensitivity differences were larger using a subset of items (0.732 vs. 0.600) and hazard ratios were 13%-19% higher across adjustment sets compared to estimates using gold-standard dementia status. Simulations indicated specificity and differential algorithmic performance between exposure groups may have large effects on hazard ratios.

METHODS: Using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale and diffusion-tensor imaging, within-Black variation in the association between late-life depressive symptoms and white matter structural integrity was examined in 297 older Black participants without dementia that were enrolled across three epidemiological studies of aging and dementia. Linear regression models were used to test associations with DTI metrics (fractional anisotropy, trace of the diffusion tensor) as the outcomes and depressive symptoms as the predictor, while adjusting for age, sex, education, scanner, serotonin-reuptake inhibitor use, total volume of white-matter hyperintensities normalized by intracranial volume, and presence of white-matter hyperintensities at the voxel level. RESULTS: Higher level of self-reported late-life depressive symptoms was associated with greater diffusion-tensor trace (reduced white matter integrity) in connections between commissural pathways and contralateral prefrontal regions (superior and middle frontal/dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), association pathways connecting dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with insular, striatal and thalamic regions, and association pathways connecting the parietal, temporal and occipital lobes and the thalamus.

However, the biological pathways underlying these associations are frequently unknown, limiting understanding of these findings and hindering downstream translational efforts such as drug target discovery. RESULTS: To expand our understanding of the underlying biological pathways and mechanisms controlling blood lipid levels, we leverage a large multi-ancestry meta-analysis (N = 1,654,960) of blood lipids to prioritize putative causal genes for 2286 lipid associations using six gene prediction approaches. Using phenome-wide association (PheWAS) scans, we identify relationships of genetically predicted lipid levels to other diseases and conditions. We confirm known pleiotropic associations with cardiovascular phenotypes and determine novel associations, notably with cholelithiasis risk. We perform sex-stratified GWAS meta-analysis of lipid levels and show that 3-5% of autosomal lipid-associated loci demonstrate sex-biased effects. Finally, we report 21 novel lipid loci identified on the X chromosome. Many of the sex-biased autosomal and X chromosome lipid loci show pleiotropic associations with sex hormones, emphasizing the role of hormone regulation in lipid metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our findings provide insights into the biological mechanisms through which associated variants lead to altered lipid levels and potentially cardiovascular disease risk.",27/12/2022,268,Genome Biol,PubMed,PMID: 36575460 PMCID: PMC9793579,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36575460,"Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetics; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Cholesterol; Genetic Pleiotropy; Genome-wide association study; GWAS; Lipids; Sex Characteristics",

We used causal mediation methods to characterize pathways linking the APOE genotype to late-life cognition through Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD neuropathologies. METHODS: We analyzed autopsy data from 1671 individuals from the Religious Orders Study, Memory and Aging Project, and Minority Aging Research Study (ROS/MAP/MARS) studies with cognitive assessment within 5 years of death and autopsy measures of AD (amyloid beta (Aβ), neurofibrillary tangles), vascular (athero/arteriolo-sclerosis, micro-infarcts/macro-infarcts), and non-AD neurodegenerative neuropathologies (TAR DNA protein 43 [TDP-43], Lewy bodies, amyloid angiopathy, hippocampal sclerosis). RESULTS: The detrimental effect of APOE ε4 on cognition was mediated by summary measures of AD and non-AD neurodegenerative neuropathologies but not vascular neuropathologies; effects were strongest in individuals with dementia. The protective effect of APOE ε2 was partly mediated by AD neuropathology and stronger in women than in men. DISCUSSION: The APOE genotype influences cognition and dementia through multiple neuropathological pathways, with implications for different therapeutic strategies targeting people at increased risk for dementia. HIGHLIGHTS: Both apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε2 and APOE ε4 effects on late-life cognition are mediated by AD neuropathology. The estimated mediated effects of most measures of AD neuropathology were similar. Non-Alzheimer's disease (AD) neurodegenerative pathologies mediate the effect of ε4 independently from AD.

Instead, some people maintain relatively normal cognitive functioning despite neuropathologic burden, a phenomenon called cognitive resilience. Using a longitudinal, epidemiological, clinical-pathologic cohort study of older adults in the United States (N = 348), the present research investigated associations between well-being and cognitive resilience. Consistent with preregistered hypotheses, results showed that higher eudaimonic well-being (measured via the Ryff Psychological Well-Being Scale) and higher hedonic well-being (measured via the Satisfaction with Life Scale) were associated with better-than-expected cognitive functioning relative to one's neuropathological burden (i.e., beta-amyloid, neurofibrillary tangles, Lewy bodies, vascular pathologies, hippocampal sclerosis, and TDP-43). The association of eudaimonic well-being in particular was present above and beyond known cognitive resilience factors (i.e., socioeconomic status, education, cognitive activity, low neuroticism, low depression) and dementia risk factors (i.e., apolipoprotein E [ApoE] genotype, medical comorbidities).

We compared the severity of arteriolosclerosis and its associations with cerebrovascular disease risk factors (CVD-RFs) in multiple locations in the brain and spinal cord. Participants (n = 390) were recruited in the context of a longitudinal community-based clinical-pathological study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project. CVD-RFs were assessed annually for an average of 8.7 (SD = 4.3) years before death. The annual assessments included systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, diabetes mellitus (DM), low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, body mass index, and smoking. Postmortem pathological assessments included assessment of arteriolosclerosis severity using the same rating scale in three brain locations (basal ganglia, frontal, and parietal white matter regions) and four spinal cord levels (cervical, thoracic, lumbar and sacral levels). A single measure was used to summarize the severity of spinal arteriolosclerosis assessments at the four levels due to their high correlations. Average age at death was 91.5 (SD = 6.2) years, and 73% were women. Half showed arteriolosclerosis in frontal white matter and spinal cord followed by parietal white matter (38%) and basal ganglia (27%). The severity of arteriolosclerosis in all three brain locations showed mild-to-moderate correlations. By contrast, spinal arteriolosclerosis was associated with brain arteriolosclerosis only in frontal white matter. Higher DBP was associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis in all three brain locations. DM was associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis only in frontal white matter. Controlling for DBP, higher SBP was inversely associated with arteriolosclerosis in parietal white matter. Blood cholesterol and triglyceride, high body mass index, or smoking were not related to the severity of arteriolosclerosis in any brain region.

We obtained a personalized multilevel molecular index of AD dementia progression that predicts severity of neuropathologies, and identified three robust molecular-based subtypes that explain much of the pathologic and clinical heterogeneity of AD. These subtypes present distinct patterns of alteration in DNA methylation, RNA, proteins, and metabolites, identifiable in the brain and subsequently in blood. In addition, the genetic variations that predispose to the various AD subtypes in brain predict distinct spatial patterns of alteration in cell types, suggesting a unique influence of each putative AD variant on neuropathological mechanisms.

However, the relationship among sleep, astrocyte activation, and cognition in humans is uncertain. METHODS: We used RNA-seq to quantify the prefrontal cortex expression of a panel of human activated astrocyte marker genes in 1076 older adults in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, 411 of whom had multi-day actigraphy prior to death. We related this to rest fragmentation, a proxy for sleep fragmentation, and to longitudinal cognitive function. RESULTS: Fragmentation of rest periods was associated with higher expression of activated astrocyte marker genes, which was associated with a lower level and faster decline of cognitive function. DISCUSSION: Astrocyte activation and fragmented rest are associated with each other and with accelerated cognitive decline. If experimental studies confirm a causal relationship, targeting sleep fragmentation and astrocyte activation may benefit cognition in older adults. HIGHLIGHTS: Greater fragmentation of rest periods, a proxy for sleep fragmentation, is associated with higher composite expression of a panel of genes characteristic of activated astrocytes. Increased expression of genes characteristic of activated astrocytes was associated with a lower level and more rapid decline of cognitive function, beyond that accounted for by the burden of amyloid and neurofibrillary tangle pathology.

However, the effects of APOE4 on the human brain are not fully understood, limiting opportunities to develop targeted therapeutics for individuals carrying APOE4 and other risk factors for Alzheimer's disease4-8. Here, to gain more comprehensive insights into the impact of APOE4 on the human brain, we performed single-cell transcriptomics profiling of post-mortem human brains from APOE4 carriers compared with non-carriers. This revealed that APOE4 is associated with widespread gene expression changes across all cell types of the human brain. Consistent with the biological function of APOE2-6, APOE4 significantly altered signalling pathways associated with cholesterol homeostasis and transport. Confirming these findings with histological and lipidomic analysis of the post-mortem human brain, induced pluripotent stem-cell-derived cells and targeted-replacement mice, we show that cholesterol is aberrantly deposited in oligodendrocytes-myelinating cells that are responsible for insulating and promoting the electrical activity of neurons. We show that altered cholesterol localization in the APOE4 brain coincides with reduced myelination. Pharmacologically facilitating cholesterol transport increases axonal myelination and improves learning and memory in APOE4 mice.

Very little is known about the role of cerebrovascular pathologies with scam susceptibility. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of diverse cerebrovascular pathologies (globally and regionally) with scam susceptibility. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This clinical-pathological cohort study included participants from 2 ongoing studies of aging that began enrollment in 1994 and 1997. In 2010, participants were enrolled in the decision-making and behavioral economics substudy and were followed up for a mean (SD) of 3.4 (2.6) years prior to death. From 1365 older persons with clinical evaluations, 69 were excluded for having dementia at baseline. From 538 older persons who died, 408 had annual assessments for scam susceptibility, cardiovascular risk burden, and cognitive function and consented to brain donation for detailed neuropathologic examination. Data were analyzed from June 2021 through September 2022. EXPOSURES: Neuropathologic examination identified the presence of macroscopic and microscopic infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and common neurodegenerative pathologies (Alzheimer disease, limbic-predominant age-related transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 encephalopathy, and Lewy bodies). RESULTS: There was a total of 408 participants. The mean (SD) age at death was 91 (6.1) years, the mean (SD) amount of education was 15.6 (3.1) years, and 297 (73%) were women. Participants included 4 Latino individuals (1%), 7 non-Latino Black individuals (2%), and 397 non-Latino White individuals (97%). The frequency of participants with macroscopic infarcts was 38% (n = 154), microinfarcts was 40% (n = 163), and moderate to severe vessel disease; specifically, atherosclerosis was 20% (n = 83), arteriolosclerosis was 25% (n = 100), and cerebral amyloid angiopathy was 35% (n = 143). In linear regression models adjusted for demographics and neurodegenerative pathologies, macroscopic infarcts were associated with greater scam susceptibility (estimate [SE], 0.18 [0.07]; P = .009). This association persisted after adjusting for cardiovascular risk burden and global cognition. Regionally, infarcts localized to the frontal, temporal, and occipital lobes and thalamus were associated with greater scam susceptibility. Neither arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, nor microinfarcts were associated with scam susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cerebrovascular pathologies, specifically cerebral infarcts, is linked with greater scam susceptibility in older adults, independent of common neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the long-term BMI trajectories preceding incident MCI and dementia and explore whether they are associated with brain pathologies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) was an ongoing community-based cohort study. This study included cognitively intact participants aged 60 to 90 years at baseline with annual follow-up from October 1997 to December 2020 (maximum follow-up of 22 years). During the follow-up, participants underwent brain autopsies. Data were analyzed from August 2021 to February 2022 using mixed-effect models. EXPOSURES: BMI was calculated using height and weight measured at baseline and follow-ups. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Incident MCI and dementia were diagnosed following standard criteria. Neuropathological assessments (including global Alzheimer disease and vascular pathology) were performed for autopsies. RESULTS: A total of 1390 participants (mean [SD] age, 78.4 [6.5] years; 1063 female [76.5%]) were included in the study. In the analysis of BMI trajectories before MCI (n = 939), during the follow-up (median [IQR] duration, 6 [3-9] years), 371 participants (39.5%) developed MCI, of whom 88 (23.7%) progressed to dementia. Those who developed MCI were older (mean [SD] age, 79.6 [5.9] years vs 76.9 [6.6] years), consumed less alcohol (median [IQR] consumption, 0 [0-5.8] g/day vs 1.1 [0-6.9] g/day), had a lower BMI (mean [SD], 27.2 [4.9] vs 28.2 [5.9]), and were more likely to be apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 carriers (89 of 371 [24.0%] vs 98 of 568 [17.3%]) compared with those who remained cognitively intact over follow-up. Those who developed dementia were older (mean [SD] age, 81.0 [5.2] years vs 79.1 [6.0] years), had a lower level of physical activity (median [IQR] activity, 1.0 [0-2.5] h/week vs 1.8 [0.2-3.8] h/week), and were more likely to be APOE ε4 carriers than those who were dementia-free (33 of 88 [37.5%] vs 56 of 283 [19.8%]). Compared with participants who remained cognitively intact, in those with incident MCI, BMI tended to decline earlier and faster. From 7 years before diagnosis, people with incident MCI had an associated significantly lower BMI (mean difference, -0.96; 95% CI, -1.85 to -0.07) than those who were cognitively intact. Among people with incident MCI, the slopes of BMI decline did not differ significantly between those who did and did not develop dementia (β, -0.03; 95% CI, -0.21 to 0.15). In the analysis of BMI trajectories before autopsy (n = 358), BMI was associated with a faster declination among participants with a high burden of global Alzheimer disease pathology (β for pathology × time highest vs lowest tertile, -0.14; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.02) or vascular pathology (β for pathology × time2 highest vs lowest tertile, 0.02; 95% CI, 0-0.05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Results of this cohort study suggest that among cognitively intact people, significantly lower BMI occurs beginning approximately 7 years before MCI diagnosis. After MCI diagnosis, BMI declines at the same pace in people who develop dementia and those who do not.

Little is known about the role of protein abundance and posttranslational modifications in AD progression and treatment, in particular large-scale intact N-linked glycoproteomics analysis. To elucidate the N-glycoproteome landscape, we developed an approach based on multi-lectin affinity enrichment, hydrophilic interaction chromatography, and LC-MS-based glycoproteomics. We analyzed brain tissue from 10 persons with no cognitive impairment or AD, 10 with asymptomatic AD, and 10 with symptomatic AD, detecting over 300 glycoproteins and 1900 glycoforms across the samples. The majority of glycoproteins have N-glycans that are high-mannosidic or complex chains that are fucosylated and bisected. The Man5 N-glycan was found to occur most frequently at >20% of the total glycoforms. Unlike the glycoproteomes of other tissues, sialylation is a minor feature of the brain N-glycoproteome, occurring at <9% among the glycoforms. We observed AD-associated differences in the number of antennae, frequency of fucosylation, bisection, and other monosaccharides at individual glycosylation sites among samples from our three groups. Further analysis revealed glycosylation differences in subcellular compartments across disease stage, including glycoproteins in the lysosome frequently modified with paucimannosidic glycans.

Here, using data from a genome-wide association study of 5.4 million individuals of diverse ancestries, we show that 12,111 independent SNPs that are significantly associated with height account for nearly all of the common SNP-based heritability. These SNPs are clustered within 7,209 non-overlapping genomic segments with a mean size of around 90 kb, covering about 21% of the genome. The density of independent associations varies across the genome and the regions of increased density are enriched for biologically relevant genes. In out-of-sample estimation and prediction, the 12,111 SNPs (or all SNPs in the HapMap 3 panel2) account for 40% (45%) of phenotypic variance in populations of European ancestry but only around 10-20% (14-24%) in populations of other ancestries. Effect sizes, associated regions and gene prioritization are similar across ancestries, indicating that reduced prediction accuracy is likely to be explained by linkage disequilibrium and differences in allele frequency within associated regions. Finally, we show that the relevant biological pathways are detectable with smaller sample sizes than are needed to implicate causal genes and variants. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive map of specific genomic regions that contain the vast majority of common height-associated variants. Although this map is saturated for populations of European ancestry, further research is needed to achieve equivalent saturation in other ancestries.",2022-10,704-712,Nature,PubMed,PMID: 36224396 PMCID: PMC9605867,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36224396,"Genome, Human; Haplotypes; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Chromosome Mapping; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Body Height; Europe; Gene Frequency; Linkage Disequilibrium; Sample Size",

In this study, we investigate the association of brain copper (assessed using ICP-MS in four regions -inferior temporal, mid-frontal, anterior cingulate, and cerebellum) and dietary copper with cognitive decline and AD pathology burden (a quantitative summary of neurofibrillary tangles, diffuse and neuritic plaques in multiple brain regions) at autopsy examination among deceased participants (N = 657; age of death: 90.2(±6.2)years, 70% women, 25% APOE-ɛ4 carriers) in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. During annual visits, these participants completed cognitive assessments using a 19-test battery and dietary assessments (using a food frequency questionnaire). Regression, linear mixed-effects, and logistic models adjusted for age at death, sex, education, and APOE-ε4 status were used. Higher composite brain copper levels were associated with slower cognitive decline (β(SE) = 0.028(0.01), p = 0.001) and less global AD pathology (β(SE) = -0.069(0.02), p = 0.0004).

Dietary copper intake was not associated with brain copper levels or AD pathology. Associations of higher brain copper levels with slower cognitive decline and with less AD pathology support a role for copper dyshomeostasis in AD pathogenesis and suggest that lower brain copper may exacerbate or indicate disease severity.

N40K-Tg recapitulates N40K insolubility, erroneous splicing events, neuronal degeneration and cognitive impairment. Specifically, N40K-Tg shows the reduction of GABAergic synapse components (e.g., the GABA receptor subunit of GABRA2), and concomitant postsynaptic hyperexcitability that is rescued by a GABA receptor agonist. Crossing of N40K-Tg and the 5xFAD amyloidosis model indicates that the RNA splicing defect synergizes with the amyloid cascade to remodel the brain transcriptome and proteome, deregulate synaptic proteins, and accelerate cognitive decline.

Here, in cross-ancestry GWAS meta-analyses of 110,182 patients who have had a stroke (five ancestries, 33% non-European) and 1,503,898 control individuals, we identify association signals for stroke and its subtypes at 89 (61 new) independent loci: 60 in primary inverse-variance-weighted analyses and 29 in secondary meta-regression and multitrait analyses. On the basis of internal cross-ancestry validation and an independent follow-up in 89,084 additional cases of stroke (30% non-European) and 1,013,843 control individuals, 87% of the primary stroke risk loci and 60% of the secondary stroke risk loci were replicated (P < 0.05). Effect sizes were highly correlated across ancestries. Cross-ancestry fine-mapping, in silico mutagenesis analysis3, and transcriptome-wide and proteome-wide association analyses revealed putative causal genes (such as SH3PXD2A and FURIN) and variants (such as at GRK5 and NOS3). Using a three-pronged approach4, we provide genetic evidence for putative drug effects, highlighting F11, KLKB1, PROC, GP1BA, LAMC2 and VCAM1 as possible targets, with drugs already under investigation for stroke for F11 and PROC. A polygenic score integrating cross-ancestry and ancestry-specific stroke GWASs with vascular-risk factor GWASs (integrative polygenic scores) strongly predicted ischaemic stroke in populations of European, East Asian and African ancestry5.

We mapped rs2853499 to a novel mitochondrial small open reading frame called SHMOOSE with microprotein encoding potential. Indeed, we detected two unique SHMOOSE-derived peptide fragments in mitochondria by using mass spectrometry-the first unique mass spectrometry-based detection of a mitochondrial-encoded microprotein to date. Furthermore, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) SHMOOSE levels in humans correlated with age, CSF tau, and brain white matter volume. We followed up on these genetic and biochemical findings by carrying out a series of functional experiments. SHMOOSE acted on the brain following intracerebroventricular administration, differentiated mitochondrial gene expression in multiple models, localized to mitochondria, bound the inner mitochondrial membrane protein mitofilin, and boosted mitochondrial oxygen consumption.

New experimental systems that monitor neuronal functions in conditions approximating the AD brain may be beneficial for identifying new therapeutic strategies. METHODS: We expose cultured neurons to aqueous-soluble human brain extract from 43 individuals across a spectrum of AD pathology. Multi-electrode arrays (MEAs) and live-cell imaging were used to assess neuronal firing and neurite integrity (NI), respectively, following treatments of rat cortical neurons (MEA) and human iPSC-derived neurons (iN) with human brain extracts. RESULTS: We observe associations between spontaneous activity and Aβ42:40 levels, between neurite integrity and oligomeric Aβ, and between neurite integrity and tau levels present in the brain extracts. However, these associations with Aβ and tau do not fully account for the effects observed. Proteomic profiling of the brain extracts revealed additional candidates correlated with neuronal structure and activity. Neurotoxicity in MEA and NI assays was associated with proteins implicated in lysosomal storage disorders, while neuroprotection was associated with proteins of the WAVE regulatory complex controlling actin cytoskeleton dynamics. Elevated ganglioside GM2 activator (GM2A) associates with reductions in both NI and MEA activity, and cell-derived GM2A alone is sufficient to induce a loss of neurite integrity and a reduction in neuronal firing.

Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences",1758-535X,10.1093/gerona/glac188,"BACKGROUND: Poor pulmonary function (PF) has been linked to mortality, but the timing of PF changes before death remains unclear. We aimed to examine the association between PF and mortality and identify different PF trajectories precedes death. METHODS: Within the Rush Memory and Aging Project, 1 438 participants without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were followed for up to 22 years. PF was assessed annually using a composite score (tertiled as low, medium, and high) based on forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1), and peak expiratory flow (PEF). Survival status was observed during the follow-up period. Data were analyzed using Cox regression, Laplace regression, and mixed-effect models. RESULTS: During the follow-up, 737 (51.25%) participants died. Compared to high PF, the hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]) of mortality was 1.35 (1.05, 1.72)/1.63 (1.25, 2.12) for medium/low PF. The median survival time (95% CI) was shortened by 0.80 (0.01-1.61)/1.72 (0.43-3.01) years for participants with medium/low PF, compared to high PF. In multiadjusted trajectory analysis, the significant differences between decedents and survivors occurred at 7 years before death for composite PF (mean difference [95% CI]: 0.14 [0.02-0.25]), 6 years for FEV1 (0.21 [0.08-0.33]) and FVC (0.21 [0.08-0.34]), and 8 years for PEF (0.21 [0.06-0.37]), and became greater thereafter. CONCLUSION: Poor PF is associated with elevated mortality and shortens survival for nearly 2 years. An acceleration in PF decline tends to occur 7 years before death.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study to examine if baseline olfactory function was associated with risk of incident MCR in 1,119 adults aged 60 and older (75.1% female). The association between performance on the Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) and incident MCR risk was computed using Cox models and reported as Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) adjusted for demographic, comorbidity, and cognitive factors. Furthermore, we assessed the relationship between postmortem AD pathology as well as non-AD pathology and olfactory function at the time of MCR diagnosis using linear regression models adjusted for sex, education, age at death, and time from diagnosis to death. RESULTS: There were 544 (48.6%) incident cases of MCR over a median follow-up of 3.94 years. Lower BSIT scores (poor olfaction) at baseline were associated with an increased risk of incident MCR (HR for a 1-point increase in BSIT score, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.88-0.96) in fully adjusted models. Those with hyposmia (scores of ≤8 on the BSIT) at baseline (26.6%) were at increased risk of MCR (HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.19-1.74) compared to those with normal olfactory function. A composite measure of global AD pathology as well as presence of Lewy body pathology were both inversely and independently associated with BSIT scores at the time of incident MCR diagnosis (n=118). τ tangle density, a specific component of AD pathology, was inversely associated with olfactory function and the correlation remained after controlling for mild cognitive impairment syndrome as well as presence of Lewy body pathology. DISCUSSION: The results provide evidence that olfactory dysfunction precedes MCR incidence and is related to Alzheimer pathology; providing a clinical approach to risk stratify as well as subtype MCR.",08/09/2022,e1886-1896,Neurology,PubMed,PMID: 36240083 PMCID: PMC9620808,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/36240083,,

The current study examines longitudinal change in serial position scores as markers of subtle cognitive decline in older adults who may be in preclinical or at-risk states for AD. METHODS: This study uses longitudinal data from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Participants (n = 141) were included if they did not have dementia at enrollment, completed follow-up assessments, and died and were classified as Braak stage I or II. Memory tests were used to calculate serial position (primacy, recency), total recall, and episodic memory composite scores. A neuropathological evaluation quantified AD, vascular, and Lewy body pathologies. Mixed effects models were used to examine change in memory scores. Neuropathologies and covariates (age, sex, education, APOE e4) were examined as moderators. RESULTS: Primacy scores declined (β = -.032, p < .001), whereas recency scores increased (β = .021, p = .012). No change was observed in standard memory measures. Greater neurofibrillary tangle density and atherosclerosis explained 10.4% of the variance in primacy decline. Neuropathologies were not associated with recency change. CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with hippocampal neuropathologies, primacy score decline may be a sensitive marker of early AD-related changes. Tangle density and atherosclerosis had additive effects on decline. Recency improvement may reflect a compensatory mechanism.

Our workflow begins with categorizing items administered in each study as indicators of memory, executive functioning, language, visuospatial functioning, or none of these domains. We use confirmatory factor analysis models with data from the most recent visit on the pooled sample across these four studies for cocalibration and derive item parameters for all items. Using these item parameters, we then estimate factor scores along with corresponding standard errors for each domain for each study. We added additional studies to our pipeline as available and focused on thorough consideration of candidate anchor items with identical content and administration methods across studies. RESULTS: Prestatistical harmonization steps such qualitative and quantitative assessment of granular cognitive items and evaluating factor structure are important steps when trying to cocalibrate cognitive scores across studies.

Scores on the same metric facilitate meta-analyses of cognitive outcomes across studies or the joint analysis of individual data across studies.

Such victimization is associated with increased hospitalizations, admittance to skilled nursing facilities, and lower 5-year all-cause mortality survival rates.

METHODS: We investigated the association of self-reported fraud victimization (presence/absence) with objectively measured BP metrics leveraging cross-sectional and longitudinal data from over 1200 non-demented adults (75% female; age ~81 years) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. We first examined cross-sectional associations between baseline fraud victimization and BP, then used longitudinal data to test the hypothesis that fraud victimization is associated with increases in BP after incident fraud. During up to 11 years of annual observation, participants were queried for fraud victimization and underwent serial BP measurements to calculate per visit averages of systolic and diastolic BP, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure. RESULTS: Cross-sectional analyses established that fraud victimization at baseline was associated with higher BP values. Next, using longitudinal changepoint analyses, we showed that fraud victimization was associated with elevations in BP among men but not women. Specifically, men who reported incident fraud exhibited increases in all BP metrics post-fraud. CONCLUSION: Results suggest an important link between fraud victimization and BP, particularly among men. Older men showed significant elevations in BP after incident fraud that, compounded over time, may portend other adverse health outcomes.",2022-11,3185-3194,J Am Geriatr Soc,PubMed,PMID: 35920078 PMCID: PMC9669148,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35920078,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; aging; Sex Characteristics; Cross-Sectional Studies; Blood Pressure; Hypertension; blood pressure; Self Report; Crime Victims; Fraud; fraud victimization",

Epigenetic age predictors based on 5' cytosine methylation (DNAm), or epigenetic clocks, have previously suggested that epigenetic age acceleration may occur in AD brain tissue. Epigenetic clocks are promising tools for the quantification of biological aging, yet we hypothesize that investigation of brain aging in AD will be assisted by the development of brain-specific epigenetic clocks. Therefore, we generated a novel age predictor termed PCBrainAge that was trained solely in cortical samples. This predictor utilizes a combination of principal components analysis and regularized regression, which reduces technical noise and greatly improves test-retest reliability. To characterize the scope of PCBrainAge's utility, we generated DNAm data from multiple brain regions in a sample from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. PCBrainAge captures meaningful heterogeneity of aging: Its acceleration demonstrates stronger associations with clinical AD dementia, pathologic AD, and APOE ε4 carrier status compared to extant epigenetic age predictors. It further does so across multiple cortical and subcortical regions.

RESULTS: We observed widespread metabolic dysregulation associated with AD, spanning 298 metabolites from various AD-relevant pathways. These included alterations to bioenergetics, cholesterol metabolism, neuroinflammation, and metabolic consequences of neurotransmitter ratio imbalances.

However, such multimodal templates have not been constructed for the brain of older adults. The purpose of this work was threefold: (A) to introduce an iterative method for construction of multimodal T1w and DTI templates that aims at maximizing the quality of each template separately as well as the spatial matching between templates, (B) to use this method to develop T1w and DTI templates of the older adult brain in a common space, and (C) to evaluate the performance of the method across iterations and compare it to the performance of state-of-the-art approaches based on multichannel registration. It was demonstrated that more iterations of the proposed method enhanced the characteristics and spatial matching of the resulting T1w and DTI templates. The templates of the older adult brain generated by the final iteration of the proposed method provided better delineation of brain structures, higher discriminability between tissues, and higher image sharpness near the cortex compared to templates generated with approaches employing multichannel registration. In addition, the spatial matching between the T1w and DTI templates constructed by the proposed method approximated the template alignment achieved with methods employing multichannel registration. Finally, when using the templates generated by the proposed method as references for spatial normalization of older adult T1w and DTI data, both the intra-modality inter-subject normalization precision and the inter-modality spatial matching were higher in most metrics than those achieved with templates constructed with other methods.

A significant increase in FMNL2 expression was observed in the brains of patients with brain infarcts and AD pathology and was associated with amyloid and phosphorylated tau deposition. FMNL2 was also prominent in astroglia in AD among those with cerebrovascular pathology. Amyloid toxicity in zebrafish increased fmnl2a expression in astroglia with detachment of astroglial end feet from blood vessels. Knockdown of fmnl2a prevented gliovascular remodeling, reduced microglial activity and enhanced amyloidosis. APP/PS1dE9 AD mice also displayed increased Fmnl2 expression and reduced the gliovascular contacts independent of the gliotic response. Based on this work, we propose that FMNL2 regulates pathology-dependent plasticity of the blood-brain-barrier by controlling gliovascular interactions and stimulating the clearance of extracellular aggregates.

METHODS: Individuals in the Religious Orders Study/Memory and Ageing Project cohorts with longitudinal measures of blood lipids and detailed autopsies were studied. We modelled the relationship between blood lipids and 12 age-related brain pathologies using a linear mixed model adjusted for potential confounding factors and stratified by APOE genotype with overall significance determined by meta-analysis. Blood lipids considered were LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Brain pathologies included AD pathology measured by silver staining (Braak stage, a modified Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease [CERAD] score and global AD pathology) and immunohistochemistry (beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles) as well as cerebral microinfarct, cerebral macroinfarct, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, cerebral atherosclerosis, hippocampal sclerosis, TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions and Lewy bodies.

Studying individuals who are resilient to the cognitive consequences of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology may uncover novel therapeutic targets to treat Alzheimer's disease. It is well established that there are sex differences in response to Alzheimer's disease pathology, and growing evidence suggests that genetic factors may contribute to these differences. Taken together, we sought to elucidate sex-specific genetic drivers of resilience. We extended our recent large scale genomic analysis of resilience in which we harmonized cognitive data across four cohorts of cognitive ageing, in vivo amyloid PET across two cohorts, and autopsy measures of amyloid neuritic plaque burden across two cohorts. These data were leveraged to build robust, continuous resilience phenotypes. With these phenotypes, we performed sex-stratified [n (males) = 2093, n (females) = 2931] and sex-interaction [n (both sexes) = 5024] genome-wide association studies (GWAS), gene and pathway-based tests, and genetic correlation analyses to clarify the variants, genes and molecular pathways that relate to resilience in a sex-specific manner. Estimated among cognitively normal individuals of both sexes, resilience was 20-25% heritable, and when estimated in either sex among cognitively normal individuals, resilience was 15-44% heritable. In our GWAS, we identified a female-specific locus on chromosome 10 [rs827389, β (females) = 0.08, P (females) = 5.76 × 10-09, β (males) = -0.01, P(males) = 0.70, β (interaction) = 0.09, P (interaction) = 1.01 × 10-04] in which the minor allele was associated with higher resilience scores among females. This locus is located within chromatin loops that interact with promoters of genes involved in RNA processing, including GATA3. Finally, our genetic correlation analyses revealed shared genetic architecture between resilience phenotypes and other complex traits, including a female-specific association with frontotemporal dementia and male-specific associations with heart rate variability traits. We also observed opposing associations between sexes for multiple sclerosis, such that more resilient females had a lower genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis, and more resilient males had a higher genetic susceptibility to multiple sclerosis. Overall, we identified sex differences in the genetic architecture of resilience, identified a female-specific resilience locus and highlighted numerous sex-specific molecular pathways that may underly resilience to Alzheimer's disease pathology.

Parkinsonism was present if there was clinical evidence of ≥2 parkinsonian signs. Postmortem brain examination collected indices of pathologies, including atherosclerosis of the large vessels of the circle of Willis.

Statin use at baseline (n = 936) was associated with a lower risk of parkinsonism (hazard ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.74-0.96, p = 0.008), controlling for demographics, vascular risk factors, and diseases. Among the decedents (n = 1,044, mean age at death 89.2 years, SD 6.7 years), statin use before death was associated with a lower odds of atherosclerosis (odds ratio [OR] 0.63, 95% CI 0.50-0.79, p < 0.001). In a mediation analysis, both a direct (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.54-0.93, p = 0.008) and an indirect (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.97, p = 0.002) pathway via less severe atherosclerosis linked statins to parkinsonism, indicating that atherosclerosis mediated 17% of the association between statins and parkinsonism. DISCUSSION: Adults using statins have a lower risk of parkinsonism that may be partially mediated by a lower odds of brain atherosclerosis. These findings highlight the role of cerebrovascular pathologies in late-life parkinsonism and suggest a potential role for statins in decreasing its magnitude. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that statin use is associated with a lower risk of parkinsonism in older adults.",10/05/2022,e1976-e1984,Neurology,PubMed,PMID: 35321928 PMCID: PMC9141626,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35321928,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Atherosclerosis; Brain; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Intracranial Arteriosclerosis; Parkinsonian Disorders,

We investigate the association of PF with motor function trajectories and disability progression, and explore the role of social activity, cognitive function, and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) in this relationship. METHODS: Within the Rush Memory and Aging Project, 1 403 disability-free participants (mean age: 79.28 years) were followed for up to 22 years. PF was measured with a composite score based on peak expiratory flow, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and forced vital capacity at baseline. Global motor function including dexterity, gait, and hand strength was assessed annually using 10 motor tests. Disability was evaluated according to the basic activities of daily living. Social activity was defined as the frequency of common types of social interaction. Global cognitive function was assessed using a battery of 19 cognitive performance tests. CVDs (including stroke, congestive heart failure, and heart diseases) were ascertained at baseline. Linear mixed-effects models were used. RESULTS: Compared to high PF, low PF was related to faster decline in global motor function (β = -0.005, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.008 to -0.001) and all 3 specific motor abilities (p < .05), as well as faster progression of disability (β = 0.012, 95% CI: 0.009 to 0.014). There was a statistically significant interaction between PF and social activity/cognitive function on disability progression (β = 0.005, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.009, p = .010/β = 0.004, 95% CI: 0.001 to 0.009, p = .025).

This proteome-wide discovery study sought to identify proteins that may provide motor resilience. METHODS: We studied the brains of older decedents with annual motor testing, postmortem brain pathologies, and proteome-wide data. Parkinsonism was assessed using 26 items of a modified United Parkinson Disease Rating Scale. We used linear mixed-effect models to isolate motor resilience, defined as the person-specific estimate of progressive parkinsonism after controlling for age, sex, and 10 brain pathologies. A total of 8 356 high-abundance proteins were quantified from dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex using tandem mass tag and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: There were 391 older adults (70% female), mean age 80 years at baseline and 89 years at death. Five proteins were associated with motor resilience: A higher level of AP1B1 (Estimate -0.504, SE 0.121, p = 3.12 × 10-5) and GNG3 (Estimate -0.276, SE 0.068, p = 4.82 × 10-5) was associated with slower progressive parkinsonism. By contrast, a higher level of TTC38 (Estimate 0.140, SE 0.029, p = 1.87 × 10-6), CARKD (Estimate 0.413, SE 0.100, p = 3.50 × 10-5), and ABHD14B (Estimate 0.175, SE 0.044, p = 6.48 × 10-5) was associated with faster progressive parkinsonism. Together, these 5 proteins accounted for almost 25% of the variance of progressive parkinsonism above the 17% accounted for by 10 indices of brain pathologies.

Brain proteomes (N = 525) were profiled from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex using mass spectrometry. The Million Veteran Program (MVP) PTSD GWAS (n = 186,689) was used for the discovery PWAS, and the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium PTSD GWAS (n = 174,659) was used for the confirmatory PWAS. To understand whether genes identified at the protein-level were also evident at the transcript-level, we performed a transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS) using human brain transcriptomes (N = 888) and the MVP PTSD GWAS results. We identified 11 genes that contribute to PTSD pathogenesis via their respective cis-regulated brain protein abundance. Seven of 11 genes (64%) replicated in the confirmatory PWAS and 4 of 11 also had their cis-regulated brain mRNA levels associated with PTSD. High confidence level was assigned to 9 of 11 genes after considering evidence from the confirmatory PWAS and TWAS.

This project applied secondary data analysis to the Rush Memory and Aging Project (N = 1954; baseline Mage = 80 years; 74% female) over up to 23 annual assessments. Multistate survival modeling examined the extent to which conscientiousness, neuroticism, and extraversion, assessed using the NEO Five Factor Inventory, were associated with transitions between cognitive status categories and death. Additionally, multinomial regression models estimated cognitive health span and total survival based on standard deviation units of personality traits. Adjusting for demographics, depressive symptoms, and apolipoprotein (APOE) ε4, personality traits were most important in the transition from no cognitive impairment (NCI) to MCI. For instance, higher conscientiousness was associated with a decreased risk of transitioning from NCI to MCI, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.78, 95% CI [0.72, 0.85] and higher neuroticism was associated with an increased risk of transitioning from NCI to MCI, HR = 1.12, 95% CI [1.04, 1.21]. Additional significant and nonsignificant results are discussed in the context of the existing literature. While personality traits were not associated with total longevity, individuals higher in conscientiousness and extraversion, and lower in neuroticism, had more years of cognitive health span, particularly female participants. These findings provide novel understanding of the simultaneous associations between personality traits and transitions between cognitive status categories and death, as well as cognitive health span and total longevity.

However, the specific association of TBI, even without loss of consciousness (LOC), with pathologic findings that underlie Alzheimer dementia, including Alzheimer disease (AD), non-AD neurodegenerative, and vascular pathologic findings, remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between TBI with and without LOC and neuropathologic findings in community-based cohorts. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional analysis used neuropathologic data from 1689 participants from the Religious Orders Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, and the Minority Aging Research Study. These studies began enrollment in 1994, 1997, and 2004, respectively. The current study's data set was frozen on April 3, 2021, when the mean (SD) length of follow-up for the participants was 8.7 (5.5) years. EXPOSURE: Traumatic brain injury exposure was assessed using a standardized, self-reported questionnaire at baseline and annual follow-up visits. Participants were categorized into those (1) without TBI exposure (n = 1024), (2) with TBI with LOC (n = 161), or (3) with TBI without LOC (n = 504). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Neuropathologic measures of amyloid-β, paired helical filament tangles, neocortical Lewy bodies, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43, hippocampal sclerosis, gross infarcts, and microinfarcts were assessed. Multiple linear regression and logistic regression models were used to determine whether TBI with or without LOC (compared with no TBI exposure as the reference group) was associated with neuropathologic outcomes after adjusting for age at death, sex, and educational level. Whether the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele and sex differences modified associations was also examined. RESULTS: A total of 1689 participants (1138 [67%] women and 551 [33%] men; mean [SD] age at death, 89.2 [6.7] years; 80 [5%] Black, 46 [3%] Latino, 1639 [97%] non-Latino, and 1601 [95%] White) participated in the study. Compared with participants without TBI, participants with TBI with LOC had a greater amyloid-β load (estimate, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.06-0.43; P = .008) and higher odds of having 1 or more gross infarcts (odds ratio [OR], 1.45; 95% CI, 1.04-2.02; P = .02) and 1 or more microinfarcts (OR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.21-2.38; P = .002), particularly subcortical microinfarcts (OR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.23-2.79; P = .002). Those with TBI without LOC had higher odds of neocortical Lewy bodies (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.01-1.87; P = .04) and 1 or more cortical microinfarcts (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.09-1.87; P = .008). The association of TBI with and without LOC with vascular pathologic outcomes persisted after controlling for vascular risk factors and vascular disease burden. Traumatic brain injury with or without LOC was not associated with paired helical filament tangles, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43, or hippocampal sclerosis. No interactions occurred with APOE ε4 or sex. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cross-sectional analysis suggests that a history of TBI, even without LOC, is associated with age-related neuropathologic outcomes, both neurodegenerative and vascular. The variation in the neuropathologic outcomes in individuals with and without LOC may provide clues to potential mechanisms, diagnoses, and management in persons with TBI.",01/04/2022,e229311,JAMA Netw Open,PubMed,PMID: 35476062 PMCID: PMC9047640,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35476062,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Amyloid beta-Peptides; DNA-Binding Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Cross-Sectional Studies; Sclerosis; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Independent Living; Infarction; Unconsciousness",

The goal of this study was to investigate the associations of dietary AGEs (dAGEs) with cognitive decline in older adults. METHODS: Non-demented older adults (n = 684) underwent annual testing with 19 cognitive tests summarized as a global cognitive score based on five cognitive domains. We modified a previously validated food frequency questionnaire designed to assess dAGE. The modified questionnaire assessed portion size and frequency of consumption of six food groups (meat, poultry, fish, cheese, spreads, and processed foods), as well as the method of their preparation (e.g., grilling, boiling). dAGE was the sum of the scores of the six food groups. Linear mixed-effect models were used to examine the association of baseline dAGE with cognitive decline. All models controlled for age, sex, education, race, and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Average follow-up was 3.0 years. Higher baseline dAGEs was associated with a faster rate of global cognitive decline (Estimate = -0.003 (standard error = 0.001, p-value = 0.015). This association was driven by declines in episodic memory (-0.004 (0.002, 0.013)) and perceptual speed (-0.003 (0.001, 0.049)) but not by semantic memory, working memory, and visuospatial domains. These associations were not attenuated by controlling for cardiovascular risk factors and diseases, including diabetes. Levels of dAGE of the specific food groups were not associated with cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of dietary AGE levels in older adults are associated with faster cognitive decline. These data lend further support for the importance of diet and that its modification may slow or prevent late-life cognitive impairment. Further clinical studies will be needed and the molecular mechanisms underlying these associations will need to be identified.",31/03/2022,1468,Nutrients,PubMed,PMID: 35406081 PMCID: PMC9003315,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35406081,"Animals; Cognitive Dysfunction; cognitive decline; Independent Living; Diet; advanced glycation end-products; diet; Eating; Glycation End Products, Advanced",

Thus, we quantified associations of modifiable, psychosocial risk factors to years of delayed onset of dementia. DESIGN: Two prospective cohorts (n=2860) with negative and positive psychosocial factors measured at baseline (depressive symptoms, neuroticism, cognitive activity). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Religious Orders Study of older priests, nuns and brothers across the USA, initiated in 1994; Rush Memory and Aging Project, of older persons in Chicago area, initiated in 1997. OUTCOME MEASURE: We conducted annual neurological and neuropsychological assessments to identify AD (n=785 incident cases). We compared age at diagnosis of AD across psychosocial risk factor groups, controlling for confounders, using accelerated failure time models. RESULTS: We found strong relations of three or more depressive symptoms with age at AD diagnosis; estimated mean age at diagnosis was 86.9 years with significant symptoms versus 92.1 years with no symptoms (p=0.001). In addition, neuroticism was inversely related to age at AD diagnosis; estimated mean age at diagnosis was 88.8 years for the highest neuroticism tertile and 93.1 years in the lowest tertile (p<0.001). Participants with higher cognitive activity (such as reading books) had later AD diagnosis; estimated mean age at diagnosis was 89.2 years for the lowest cognitive activity group and 92.6 years for the highest activity group (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Higher depressive symptoms were associated with 5-year acceleration in AD; higher neuroticism with 4-year acceleration and higher cognitive activity with a 3.5-year delay. To translate findings, prior health services research in the USA indicates delaying dementia 5 years could add 3 years of life and reduce individual costs of care >$60 000.

We tested whether aggregating cortical peptides associated with cognitive resilience into an index can identify adults with higher or lower cognitive resilience. METHODS: We used data from 1,192 older decedents, including annual clinical testing, indices of 10 Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementia (ADRD) pathologies, and 226 proteotypic peptides measured in the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex. We used linear mixed-effects models to identify peptides that were related to cognitive resilience (i.e., cognitive decline not explained by ADRD pathologies [false discovery rate <0.05]). We aggregated the expression levels of these resilience peptides into a person-specific cognitive resilience index and examined its association with AD clinical and pathologic phenotypes. RESULTS: We constructed a resilience index from 52 of 226 peptides related to cognitive resilience. A higher index was associated with slower cognitive decline (estimate 0.05, SE 0.003, p < 0.001) and slower motor decline (estimate 0.005, SE 0.001, p < 0.001). Most resilience peptides (70%) were specific to cognitive decline, but 30% also provided resilience for motor decline. A higher index was also related to a lower burden of AD pathologies (odds ratio [OR] 0.41, SE 0.01, p < 0.001) and modified the association of AD pathology with cognition in that a higher index modified the negative effects of AD pathology on AD dementia proximate to death (OR 0.70, SE 0.14, p = 0.010). Up to 90% of cognitive resilience peptides were related to AD pathologic phenotypes. DISCUSSION: Cortical proteins may provide some degree of cognitive resilience. These multifunctional proteins also seem to provide resilience to other AD clinical phenotypes and have independent associations with ADRD pathologies.

METHODS: We included 888 participants aged 59+ years from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and 303,887 participants aged 55+ years from the UK Biobank (UKB). MAP participants took part in annual cognitive testing. Diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical neurological examination and standardized criteria. A subset provided postmortem tissue for neuropathologic evaluation for common age-related diseases (eg, Alzheimer's disease [AD], Lewy bodies, and vascular). For UKB, dementia was determined by linked hospital and death records. Self-reported caffeine intake was estimated using food-frequency questionnaires in both cohorts. Cox proportional hazard ratio (HR), regression, and mixed models were used to examine associations of caffeine intake with incident dementia, cognitive decline, and neuropathology. RESULTS: In MAP, compared to ≤100 mg/day, caffeine intake >100 mg/day was associated with a significantly higher HR (95% confidence interval [CI]) of all-cause (HR = 1.35, 95% CI = 1.03-1.76) and AD (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.07-1.85) dementia. Caffeine intake was not associated with cognitive decline.

Similar results were observed for Alzheimer's dementia. In MAP, caffeine intake was inversely associated with postmortem Lewy bodies but no other age-related pathologies. Caffeine intake >100 mg/day was associated with lower neocortical type Lewy bodies (odds ratio (95%CI): 0.40 (95% CI = 0.21-0.75).

Watershed brain regions are located at the most distal areas between arterial territories, making them vulnerable to SVD-related changes. We examined the association of pathologic markers of SVD, specifically arteriolosclerosis in watershed brain regions, with AD pathologic changes. Participants (N = 982; mean age-at-death = 90; 69% women) were enrolled as part of one of two cohort studies of aging and dementia. At autopsy, neuropathological evaluation included semi-quantitative grading of arteriolosclerosis pathology from 2 cortical watershed regions: the anterior watershed (AWS) and posterior watershed (PWS), densities for cortical β-amyloid and tau-tangle pathology, and other common age-related pathologies. Linear regression models examined the association of watershed arteriolosclerosis pathology with β-amyloid and tau-tangle burden. In follow-up analyses, available ex-vivo MRI and proteomics data in a subset of decedents were leveraged to examine the association of whole brain measure of WMH, as a presumed MRI marker of SVD, with β-amyloid and tau-tangle burden, as well as to examine the association of watershed arteriolosclerosis with proteomic tau. Watershed arteriolosclerosis was common, with 45% of older persons having moderate-to-severe arteriolosclerosis pathology in the AWS region, and 35% in the PWS. In fully adjusted models that controlled for demographics and common age-related pathologies, an increase in severity of PWS arteriolosclerosis was associated with a higher burden of tau-tangle burden, specifically neocortical tau burden, but not with β-amyloid. AWS arteriolosclerosis was not associated with β-amyloid or tau pathology. Ex-vivo WMH was associated with greater tau-tangle pathology burden but not β-amyloid. Furthermore, PWS arteriolosclerosis was associated with higher abundance of tau phosphopeptides, that promote formation of tau aggregates.

Variation in cognitive trajectory is only partially explained by traditional neuropathologies. We sought to identify novel genes associated with cognitive trajectory using DNA methylation profiles from human postmortem brain. METHODS: We performed a brain epigenome-wide association study of cognitive trajectory in 636 participants from the ROS (Religious Orders Study) and MAP (Rush Memory and Aging Project) using DNA methylation profiles of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. To maximize our power to detect epigenetic associations, we used the recently developed Gene Association with Multiple Traits test to analyze the 5 measured cognitive domains simultaneously. RESULTS: We found an epigenome-wide association for differential methylation of sites in the CLDN5 locus and cognitive trajectory (p = 9.96 × 10-7) that was robust to adjustment for cell type proportions (p = 8.52 × 10-7). This association was primarily driven by association with declines in episodic (p = 4.65 × 10-6) and working (p = 2.54 × 10-7) memory. This association between methylation in CLDN5 and cognitive decline was significant even in participants with no or little signs of amyloid-β and neurofibrillary tangle pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Differential methylation of CLDN5, a gene that encodes an important protein of the blood-brain barrier, is associated with cognitive trajectory beyond traditional Alzheimer's disease pathologies. The association between CLDN5 methylation and cognitive trajectory in people with low pathology suggests an early role for CLDN5 and blood-brain barrier dysfunction in cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease.",15/02/2022,389-398,Biol Psychiatry,PubMed,PMID: 33838873 PMCID: PMC8329105,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33838873,Humans; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Dementia; Cognitive Dysfunction; Neuropathology; DNA Methylation; Epigenetics; Claudin-5; Cognitive trajectory; Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex; Gene-based analysis,

The APOE ε4 allele has shown cerebrovascular effects including acceleration of blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown. METHODS: We evaluated the differential expression of previously established AD genes in brains from 344 pathologically confirmed AD cases and 232 controls and in blood from 112 pathologically confirmed AD cases and 67 controls from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project. Differential gene expression between AD cases and controls was analyzed in the blood and brain jointly using a multivariate approach in the total sample and within APOE genotype groups. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed within APOE genotype groups using the results from the combined blood and brain analyses to identify biologically important pathways. Gene co-expression networks in brain and blood samples were investigated using weighted correlation network analysis. Top-ranked genes from networks and pathways were further evaluated with vascular injury traits. RESULTS: We observed differentially expressed genes with P < 0.05 in both brain and blood for established AD genes INPP5D (upregulated) and HLA-DQA1 (downregulated). PIGHP1 and FRAS1 were differentially expressed at the transcriptome-wide level (P < 3.3 × 10-6) within ε2/ε3 and ε3/ε4 groups, respectively. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed 21 significant pathways (false discovery rate P < 0.05) in at least one APOE genotype group. Ten pathways were significantly enriched in the ε3/ε4 group, and six of these were unique to these subjects. Four pathways (allograft rejection, interferon gamma response, peroxisome, and TNFA signaling via NFKB) were enriched for AD upregulated genes in the ε3/ε4 group and AD downregulated genes in subjects lacking ε4. We identified a co-expressed gene network in the brain that reproduced in blood and showed higher average expression in ε4 carriers. Twenty-three genes from pathway and network analyses were significantly associated with at least one vascular injury trait. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the APOE genotype contributes to unique expression network profiles in both blood and brain. Several genes in these networks are associated with measures of vascular injury and potentially contribute to ε4's effect on the BBB.",09/02/2022,30,Alzheimers Res Ther,PubMed,PMID: 35139885 PMCID: PMC8830081,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35139885,Alzheimer’s disease; Humans; Genotype; Brain; Gene Expression Profiling; Alzheimer Disease; APOE; Apolipoprotein E4; Apolipoproteins E; Blood-brain barrier; Co-expression network; Differential expression; Vascular injury,

However, discordance between mRNA and protein abundance, and the scarcity of proteomic data, has limited our ability to advance candidate targets that are mainly based on gene expression. Therefore, by using a deep neural network that predicts protein abundance from mRNA expression, here we attempt to track the early protein drivers of ADRD. Specifically, by applying the clei2block deep learning model to 1192 brain RNA-seq samples, we identify protein modules and disease-associated expression changes that were not directly observed at the mRNA level. Moreover, pseudo-temporal trajectory inference based on the predicted proteome became more closely correlated with cognitive decline and hippocampal atrophy compared to RNA-based trajectories. This suggests that the predicted changes in protein expression could provide a better molecular representation of ADRD progression. Furthermore, overlaying clinical traits on protein pseudotime trajectory identifies protein modules altered before cognitive impairment.

Such variation in cognitive trajectory is only partially explained by common neurodegenerative pathologies. Hence, we aimed to identify new molecular processes underlying variation in cognitive trajectory using brain microRNA profile followed by an integrative analysis with brain transcriptome and proteome. Individual cognitive trajectories were derived from longitudinally assessed cognitive-test scores of older-adult brain donors from four longitudinal cohorts. Postmortem brain microRNA profiles, transcriptomes, and proteomes were derived from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The global microRNA association study of cognitive trajectory was performed in a discovery (n = 454) and replication cohort (n = 134), followed by a meta-analysis that identified 6 microRNAs. Among these, miR-132-3p and miR-29a-3p were most significantly associated with cognitive trajectory. They explain 18.2% and 2.0% of the variance of cognitive trajectory, respectively, and act independently of the eight measured neurodegenerative pathologies. Furthermore, integrative transcriptomic and proteomic analyses revealed that miR-132-3p was significantly associated with 24 of the 47 modules of co-expressed genes of the transcriptome, miR-29a-3p with 3 modules, and identified 84 and 214 downstream targets of miR-132-3p and miR-29a-3p, respectively, in cognitive trajectory.

OBJECTIVE: To derive and validate a score obtained by a rapid and simple assessment, which guides primary care providers in predicting the risk of dementia among older adults. DESIGN: A total of 4178 participants from three longitudinal cohorts (mean age at baseline = 76.8 [SD = 7.6] years), without baseline dementia, followed annually for a median of 10 years (IQR: 5 to16 years, Reverse Kaplan-Meier). PARTICIPANTS: To derive the score, we used data from 1,780 participants from the Rush Memory and Aging Project (93% White). To validate the score, we used data from 1,299 participants from the Religious Order Study (92% White), and to assess generalizability, 679 participants from the Minority Aging Research Study (100% Black).

METHODS: In Rush Memory and Aging Project, a total of 1,378 physical health participants (mean age: 79.3 ± 7.3 years) were followed up for up to 22 years. FGCRS at baseline was assessed and categorized into tertiles (lowest, middle, and highest). Global motor function (including dexterity, gait, and hand strength) was assessed annually with 10 motor tests. CVDs (including stroke, congestive heart failure, and other heart diseases) were ascertained at baseline and follow-ups, and the number of CVDs accumulation over time was assessed. Global cognitive function was tested annually by 19 tests. Data were analyzed using the linear mixed-effects models and mediation analysis. RESULTS: At baseline, FGCRS ranged from 4 to 28 (mean score: 15.6 ± 3.7).

This study aimed to investigate whether depressive symptoms, purpose in life, and their interrelations are associated with cognitive decline in older African Americans. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We included older African Americans from the Minority Aging Research Study (n = 748) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (n = 109), without dementia at baseline. We assessed associations of depressive symptoms, purpose in life, and their interrelations, with baseline levels and change in global cognition using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: At baseline, each unit increment in depressive symptoms was related to worse initial global cognition (mean difference = -0.03 standard unit; p = .003), while higher purpose in life was related to better cognition (mean difference = 0.12; p = .002). Further, participants with ≥1 depressive symptom who had a purpose in life score above the median appeared to have better global cognition (mean difference = 0.10; p = .01), compared to those with depressive symptoms but lower levels of purpose in life. However, we did not find relations of depressive symptoms or purpose in life with rates of cognitive decline over time, likely due to the modest follow-up. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: In older African Americans, we found that lower depressive symptoms and greater purpose in life were independently related to higher initial levels of global cognition, but not cognitive decline. Preliminary findings of higher global cognition in individuals with depressive symptoms but greater purpose in life merit further investigation if purpose may eventually be considered as an intervention.",2022,igac019,Innov Aging,PubMed,PMID: 35677344 PMCID: PMC9169895,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35677344,African Americans; Cognitive function; Depressive symptoms; Linear mixed-effects models; Purpose in life,

Besides pathological approaches, unbiased evidence from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and gene network analysis implicate genes expressed in microglia that reduce phagocytic ability as susceptibility genes for AD. Thus, a central feature toward AD therapy is to increase the microglial phagocytic activities while maintaining synaptic integrity. Here, we developed a robust unbiased high content screening assay to identify potential therapeutics which can reduce the amyloid-beta (Aβ1-42) load by increasing microglial uptake ability. Our screen identified the small-molecule GW5074, an inhibitor of c-RAF, a serine/threonine kinase, which significantly increased the Aβ1-42 clearance activities in human monocyte-derived microglia-like (MDMi) cells, a microglia culture model that recapitulates many genetic and phenotypic aspects of human microglia. Notably, GW5074 was previously reported to be neuroprotective for cerebellar granule cells and cortical neurons. We found that GW5074 significantly increased the expression of key AD-associated microglial molecules known to modulate phagocytosis: TYROBP, SIRPβ1, and TREM2.

We segmented TUG into its four subtasks (i.e., walking, turning, and two postural transitions), and extracted 18 measures that were summarized into nine validated sensor metrics. Participants also underwent a detailed cognitive assessment during the same visit. We then employed a series of regression models to determine the combinations of subtask sensor metrics most strongly associated with MCI and specific cognitive abilities for each condition. We also compared subtask performances with and without dividing attention to determine whether the costs of divided attention were associated with cognition. While slower TUG walking and turning were associated with higher odds of MCI under normal conditions, these and other subtask associations became more strongly linked to MCI when TUG was performed under divided attention. Walking and turns were also most strongly associated with executive function and attention, particularly under divided attention. These differential associations with cognition were mirrored by performance costs.

We confirm that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with late onset AD (LOAD) show a strong tendency to reside in microglia-specific gene regulatory elements. Despite this significant colocalization, we find that microglia harbor more acetylation changes associated with age than with amyloid-β (Aβ) load. In contrast, we detect that an oligodendrocyte-enriched glial (OEG) population contains the majority of differentially acetylated peaks associated with Aβ load. These differential peaks reside near both early onset risk genes (APP, PSEN1, PSEN2) and late onset AD risk loci (including BIN1, PICALM, CLU, ADAM10, ADAMTS4, SORL1, FERMT2), Aβ processing genes (BACE1), as well as genes involved in myelinating and oligodendrocyte development processes. Interestingly, a number of LOAD risk loci associated with differentially acetylated risk genes contain H3K27ac peaks that are specifically enriched in OEG. These findings implicate oligodendrocyte gene regulation as a potential mechanism by which early onset and late onset risk genes mediate their effects, and highlight the deregulation of myelinating processes in AD.

We compared prevalent dementia diagnosed through the 2016 cohort evaluation versus claims identification of dementia, applying the Bynum-standard algorithm. RESULTS: Of 1 054 participants with Medicare Parts A and B FFS in a 3-year window surrounding their 2016 index date, 136 had prevalent dementia diagnosed during cohort evaluations; the claims algorithm yielded 217.

The primary dementia-protective benefits of angiotensin II subtype 1 receptor (AT1R) blockers are believed to arise from systemic effects on blood pressure.

Changes in these brain angiotensin receptors may accelerate the progression of AD. Using postmortem frontal cortex brain samples of age- and sex-matched cognitively normal individuals (n = 30) and AD patients (n = 30), we sought to dissect the b-RAS changes associated with AD and assess how these changes correlate with brain markers of oxidative stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction as well as amyloid-β and paired helical filament tau pathologies.

METHODS: We examined genetic correlation between depression and AD using linkage disequilibrium score regression. We then tested for evidence of causality between depression and AD using Mendelian randomization and genome-wide association study results. Subsequently, cis and trans quantitative trait locus analyses for the depression genome-wide association study signals were performed to resolve the genetic signals to specific DNA methylation sites, brain transcripts, and proteins. These transcripts and proteins were then examined for associations with AD and its endophenotypes. Finally, the associations between depression polygenic risk score and AD endophenotypes were examined. RESULTS: We detected a significant genetic correlation between depression and AD, suggesting that they have a shared genetic basis. Furthermore, we found that depression had a causal role in AD through Mendelian randomization but did not find evidence for a causal role of AD on depression. Moreover, we identified 75 brain transcripts and 28 brain proteins regulated by the depression genome-wide association study signals through quantitative trait locus analyses. Of these, 46 transcripts and seven proteins were associated with rates of cognitive decline over time, AD pathologies, and AD diagnosis in two separate cohorts, thus implicating them in AD.

Despite advances in prevention and treatment, in particular through reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels2, heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide3. Genome-wideassociation studies (GWAS) of blood lipid levels have led to important biological and clinical insights, as well as new drug targets, for cardiovascular disease. However, most previous GWAS4-23 have been conducted in European ancestry populations and may have missed genetic variants that contribute to lipid-level variation in other ancestry groups. These include differences in allele frequencies, effect sizes and linkage-disequilibrium patterns24. Here we conduct a multi-ancestry, genome-wide genetic discovery meta-analysis of lipid levels in approximately 1.65 million individuals, including 350,000 of non-European ancestries. We quantify the gain in studying non-European ancestries and provide evidence to support the expansion of recruitment of additional ancestries, even with relatively small sample sizes. We find that increasing diversity rather than studying additional individuals of European ancestry results in substantial improvements in fine-mapping functional variants and portability of polygenic prediction (evaluated in approximately 295,000 individuals from 7 ancestry groupings). Modest gains in the number of discovered loci and ancestry-specific variants were also achieved.

Few studies have examined the longitudinal relationship between frailty and cognition. METHODS: Participants of Rush Memory and Aging project (n = 625, 67.5% female, 83.2 ± 5.9 years at baseline) underwent annual clinical evaluations (average follow-up 5.6 ± 3.7 years) followed by neuropathologic assessment after death. A frailty index was calculated from 41 health variables at each evaluation. Clinical diagnosis of MCI and/or dementia was ascertained by clinical data review (blinded to neuropathological data) after death. Age, sex, education, and neuropathological burden (10-item index) were evaluated as covariates. Frailty trajectories were calculated using a mixed effects model. RESULTS: At baseline the mean frailty index = 0.24 ± 0.12 and increased at rate of 0.026 or ~1 deficit per year. At death, 27.7% of the sample had MCI, and 38.6% had dementia. Frailty trajectories were significantly steeper among those individuals who were ultimately diagnosed as clinically impaired prior to death, even after controlling for age, sex, education, and neuropathological index.

OBJECTIVE: To examine if the burden of cerebral white matter hyperintensity (WMH), a common manifestation of cerebrovascular disease pathologies, is associated with the rate of progressive parkinsonism. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This community-based cohort study included participants recruited in 3 ongoing cohorts that began enrollment in 1994, 1997, and 2004. Prior to death, participants were observed for a mean of 7.5 years, with annual clinical assessments. From 4427 participants enrolled in the 3 cohorts, 2134 died. Postmortem autopsy was performed in 1725 decedents, and 598 also had ex vivo brain magnetic resonance imaging. Participants were excluded if they were missing any of the 9 postmortem pathology indices (n = 22) or repeated parkinsonism assessment (n = 41) or had received a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease at any point before or during the study (n = 19). Data were analyzed from April 2020 to August 2021. EXPOSURES: WMH burden was assessed using a modified Fazekas rating scale. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Parkinsonism was assessed annually using 26 items of a modified motor portion of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. A summary score was developed from the item scores, with higher scores indicating more severe parkinsonism. RESULTS: Of 516 included decedents, 364 (70.5%) were female, and the mean (SD) age at death was 90.2 (6.4) years. Higher WMH was associated with faster progressive parkinsonism (estimate, 0.024; SE, 0.008; P = .002). The attenuation of this association was greater when controlling for indices of cerebrovascular disease pathologies than when controlling for neurodegenerative pathologies (cerebrovascular disease: estimate, 0.019; SE, 0.008; P = .02; neurodegenerative: estimate, 0.022; SE, 0.008; P = .003), but both remained significant. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, higher levels of both WMH and indices of cerebrovascular disease pathologies in aging brains were associated with more rapid progressive parkinsonism. Further studies are needed to determine if in vivo brain imaging of older adults for evidence of WMH and aggressive medical treatment of vascular risk factors and diseases can reduce the occurrence or severity of late-life parkinsonism.",01/12/2021,1494-1502,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 34724033 PMCID: PMC8561430,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34724033,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Brain; Disease Progression; Aging; Parkinsonian Disorders; White Matter",

Their sparse distribution and heterogenous phenotype have presented challenges for detecting them in human tissues. We developed a senescence eigengene approach to identify these rare cells within large, diverse populations of postmortem human brain cells. Eigengenes are useful when no single gene reliably captures a phenotype, like senescence; they also help to reduce noise, which is important in large transcriptomic datasets where subtle signals from low-expressing genes can be lost. Each of our eigengenes detected ~2% senescent cells from a population of ~140,000 single nuclei derived from 76 postmortem human brains with various levels of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. More than 97% of the senescent cells were excitatory neurons and overlapped with tau-containing neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2D (CDKN2D/p19) was predicted as the most significant contributor to the primary senescence eigengene. RNAscope and immunofluorescence confirmed its elevated expression in AD brain tissue whereby p19-expressing neurons had 1.8-fold larger nuclei and significantly more cells with lipofuscin than p19-negative neurons. These hallmark senescence phenotypes were further elevated in the presence of NFTs. Collectively, CDKN2D/p19-expressing neurons with NFTs represent a unique cellular population in human AD with a senescence phenotype.

Integration of the gene expression data in both the blood from the ADNI and the brain from the Accelerating Medicines Partnership Alzheimer's Disease (AMP-AD) program reveals ABCA1 and CPT1A are involved in the regulation of acylcarnitines and amino acids in AD. Gene co-expression network analysis of the AMP-AD brain RNA-seq data suggests the CPT1A- and ABCA1-centered subnetworks are associated with neuronal system and immune response, respectively. Increased ABCA1 gene expression and adiponectin protein, a regulator of ABCA1, correspond to decreased short-chain acylcarnitines and amines in AD in the ADNI.

Changes in the mitochondrial DNA copy number (mtDNAcn) and increased mitochondrial DNA mutation burden have both been associated with neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive decline. This study aims to systematically identify which common brain pathologies in the aged human brain are associated with mitochondrial recalibrations and to disentangle the relationship between these pathologies, mtDNAcn, mtDNA heteroplasmy, aging, neuronal loss, and cognitive function. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing data from n = 1361 human brain samples from 5 different regions were used to quantify mtDNAcn as well as heteroplasmic mtDNA point mutations and small indels. Brain samples were assessed for 10 common pathologies. Annual cognitive test results were used to assess cognitive function proximal to death. For a subset of samples, neuronal proportions were estimated from RNA-seq profiles, and mass spectrometry was used to quantify the mitochondrial protein content of the tissue. RESULTS: mtDNAcn was 7-14% lower in AD relative to control participants. When accounting for all 10 common neuropathologies, only tau was significantly associated with lower mtDNAcn in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In the posterior cingulate cortex, TDP-43 pathology demonstrated a distinct association with mtDNAcn. No changes were observed in the cerebellum, which is affected late by pathologies. Neither age nor gender was associated with mtDNAcn in the studied brain regions when adjusting for pathologies. Mitochondrial content and mtDNAcn independently explained variance in cognitive function unaccounted by pathologies, implicating complex mitochondrial recalibrations in cognitive decline. In contrast, mtDNA heteroplasmy levels increased by 1.5% per year of life in the cortical regions, but displayed no association with any of the pathologies or cognitive function. CONCLUSIONS: We studied mtDNA quantity and quality in relation to mixed pathologies of aging and showed that tau and not amyloid-β is primarily associated with reduced mtDNAcn. In the posterior cingulate cortex, the association of TDP-43 with low mtDNAcn points to a vulnerability of this region in limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy. While we found low mtDNAcn in brain regions affected by pathologies, the absence of associations with mtDNA heteroplasmy burden indicates that mtDNA point mutations and small indels are unlikely to be involved in the pathogenesis of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases.",06/11/2021,75,Mol Neurodegener,PubMed,PMID: 34742335 PMCID: PMC8572491,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34742335,"Alzheimer’s disease; Aged; Humans; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Mitochondria; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Tau; DNA, Mitochondrial; Mitochondrial DNA copy number; Mitochondrial heteroplasmy; Neurodegeneration; TDP-43",

We aimed to examine the influence of CR indicator on domain-specific cognitive trajectories taking brain pathologies into account. METHODS: Within the Rush Memory and Aging Project, 1,697 participants without dementia (mean age 79.6 years) were followed up to 21 years. CR indicator encompassing education, early-life, mid-life, and late-life cognitive activities and late-life social activity was ascertained at baseline and categorized as tertiles (lowest, middle, and highest).

During the follow-up, 648 participants died and underwent autopsies to evaluate brain pathologies. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effect models. RESULTS: Among the participants, the score of the CR indicator ranged from -8.00 to 5.74 (mean 0.00 ± 2.23). In multi-adjusted mixed-effect models, compared to the lowest CR, the highest was related to a slower decline in global cognition (β = 0.028, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.012-0.043), episodic memory (β = 0.028, 95% CI 0.010-0.047), and working memory (β = 0.019, 95% CI 0.005-0.033) during the follow-up.

The study estimated indoor room activities over 24 hours and investigated relationships between diurnal activity patterns and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). METHODS: One hundred and sixty-one older adults (26 with MCI) living alone (age = 78.9 ± 9.2) were included from 2 study cohorts-the Oregon Center for Aging & Technology and the Minority Aging Research Study. Indoor room activities were measured by the number of trips made to rooms (bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, living room). Trips made to rooms (transitions) were detected using passive infrared motion sensors fixed on the walls for a month. Latent trajectory models were used to identify distinct diurnal patterns of room activities and characteristics associated with each trajectory. RESULTS: Latent trajectory models identified 2 diurnal patterns of bathroom usage (high and low usage). Participants with MCI were more likely to be in the high bathroom usage group that exhibited more trips to the bathroom than the low-usage group (odds ratio [OR] = 4.1, 95% CI [1.3-13.5], p = .02). For kitchen activity, 2 diurnal patterns were identified (high and low activity).

This cascading epigenomic analysis for GWAS, which we refer to as CEWAS, comprises two types of models: one for linking cis genetic effects to epigenomic variation and another for linking cis epigenomic variation to gene expression. Applying these models in cascade to GWAS summary statistics generates gene level statistics that reflect genetically-driven epigenomic effects. We show on sixteen brain-related GWAS that CEWAS provides higher gene detection rate than related methods, and finds disease relevant genes and gene sets that point toward less explored biological processes. CEWAS thus presents a novel means for exploring the regulatory landscape of GWAS variants in uncovering disease mechanisms.",2021-11,e1009918,PLoS Genet,PubMed,PMID: 34807913 PMCID: PMC8648125,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34807913,"Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Alleles; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Transcriptome; Epigenome; Quantitative Trait Loci",

Series A, Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences",1758-535X,10.1093/gerona/glab320,"BACKGROUND: We tested the hypothesis that indices of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) pathologies may explain associations between change in body mass index (BMI) and cognitive decline in old age. METHOD: We used data from 436 older decedents participating in a prospective longitudinal cohort study who had undergone annual cognitive and BMI assessments and postmortem collection of indices of 12 brain pathologies. We identified ADRD brain pathologies associated with BMI range, a previously published metric of change in BMI. We employed sigmoidal mixed-effect models of cognitive decline to examine the associations of change in BMI and cognitive decline with and without terms for ADRD brain pathologies. RESULTS: Average age at baseline was 78.6 years, SD = 6.5 years with 64% female. On average, 9 cognitive assessments were obtained with average age at death 88.4 years (SD = 6.2 years). Change in BMI as measured by BMI range was associated with cognitive decline (θ 2 = 0.260). β-Amyloid, hippocampal sclerosis, and substantia nigra neuronal loss were associated with BMI range. β-Amyloid strongly attenuated the association of BMI range with cognitive decline. Hippocampal sclerosis showed only partial attenuation of the association of BMI range and cognitive decline and nigral neuronal loss did not attenuate this association. CONCLUSION: Changes in BMI and cognitive decline in older adults may be affected by similar mechanisms underlying the accumulation of brain pathologies like β-amyloid in aging brains.

However, the mechanism remains elusive. Based on recent pathophysiological evidence, we sought for the first time to identify genetic variants in BMI1 as associated with AD biomarkers, including amyloid-β. METHODS: We used genetic, longitudinal cognition, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker data from participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (N = 1565). First, we performed a gene-based association analysis of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (minor allele frequency (MAF) > 5%) located within ± 20 kb of the gene boundary of BMI1, an optimal width for including potential regulatory SNPs in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions (UTR) of BMI1, with CSF Aβ1-42 levels. Second, we performed cross-sectional and longitudinal association analyses of SNPs in BMI1 with cognitive performance using linear and mixed-effects models. We replicated association of SNPs in BMI1 with cognitive performance in an independent cohort (N=1084), Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP). RESULTS: Gene-based genetic association analysis showed that BMI1 was significantly associated with CSF Aβ1-42 levels after adjusting for multiple testing using permutation (permutation-corrected p value=0.005). rs17415557 in BMI1 showed the most significant association with CSF Aβ1-42 levels. Participants with minor alleles of rs17415557 have increased CSF Aβ1-42 levels compared to those with no minor alleles. Further analysis identified and replicated the minor allele of rs17415557 as being significantly associated with slower cognitive decline rates in AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide fundamental evidence that BMI1 rs17415557 may serve as a protective mechanism related to AD pathogenesis, which supports the results of previous studies linking BMI1 to protection against AD.",05/10/2021,164,Alzheimers Res Ther,PubMed,PMID: 34610832 PMCID: PMC8493672,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34610832,Alzheimer’s disease; Humans; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; tau Proteins; Cross-Sectional Studies; Neurogenetics; Polycomb Repressive Complex 1,

However, little is known about the relationship between LBs and LATE-NC and their combined roles in cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia in community-dwelling participants. The study included 1670 community-based participants (mean age-at-death, 89.5 years (SD = 6.65); 69% females) who underwent annual assessments of cognition to create summary measures of global cognition and cognitive domains and evaluation for Alzheimer's dementia. Systematic neuropathologic evaluations were performed to assess LBs, LATE-NC, and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. We excluded cases with pathologically confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration in this study. Logistic and linear regression analyses were used, adjusted for demographics and AD pathology. LBs were present in 428 (25.6%) decedents (29 nigra-predominant, 165 limbic-type, and 234 neocortical-type) while 865 (51.7%) decedents exhibited LATE-NC (307 stage 1, 167 stage 2, and 391 stage 3). LBs combined with LATE-NC were common (15% of all participants) and in those with Alzheimer's dementia (25%). Neocortical-type, but not nigral-predominant or limbic-type LBs increased the odds of stage 2/3 LATE-NC (odds ratio = 1.70; 95% confidence interval = 1.26-2.30). The association between neocortical-type LBs and stage 2/3 LATE-NC was stronger in those under 90 years of age and in women. In analyses of cognition and Alzheimer's dementia, LATE-NC and neocortical-type LBs, separately, were related to lower global cognition, five specific cognitive domains, and an increased odds of Alzheimer's dementia, above and beyond the AD pathology. Limbic-type LBs were related to lower global cognition, and the domains of episodic, working, and semantic memory, and increased odds of Alzheimer's dementia. Furthermore, there was no interaction between limbic/neocortical-type LBs and LATE-NC on cognitive function, cognitive domains, or Alzheimer's dementia. These findings suggest that neocortical-type LBs are associated with LATE-NC, specifically in the younger old and in women.

Yet, limited research has considered epigenetic clocks calculated in brain tissue. We used DNA methylation states in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex specimens from 721 older participants of the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, to calculate DNA methylation age using four established epigenetic clocks: Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge, GrimAge, and a new Cortical clock. The four established clocks were trained in blood samples (Hannum, PhenoAge, GrimAge) or using 51 human tissue and cell types (Horvath); the recent Cortical clock is the first trained in postmortem cortical tissue. Participants were recruited beginning in 1994 (Religious Orders Study) and 1997 (Memory and Aging Project), and followed annually with questionnaires and clinical evaluations; brain specimens were obtained for 80-90% of participants. Mean age at death was 88.0 (SD 6.7) years. We used linear regression, logistic regression, and linear mixed models, to examine relations of epigenetic clock ages to neuropathologic and clinical aging phenotypes, controlling for chronologic age, sex, education, and depressive symptomatology. Hannum, Horvath, PhenoAge and Cortical clock ages were related to pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as to Aβ load (a hallmark pathology of Alzheimer's disease). However, associations were substantially stronger for the Cortical than other clocks; for example, each standard deviation (SD) increase in Hannum, Horvath, and PhenoAge clock age was related to approximately 30% greater likelihood of pathologic AD (all p < 0.05), while each SD increase in Cortical age was related to 90% greater likelihood of pathologic AD (odds ratio = 1.91, 95% confidence interval 1.38, 2.62). Moreover, Cortical age was significantly related to other AD pathology (eg, mean tau tangle density, p = 0.003), and to odds of neocortical Lewy body pathology (for each SD increase in Cortical age, odds ratio = 2.00, 95% confidence 1.27, 3.17), although no clocks were related to cerebrovascular neuropathology. Cortical age was the only epigenetic clock significantly associated with the clinical phenotypes examined, from dementia to cognitive decline (5 specific cognitive systems, and a global cognitive measure averaging 17 tasks) to Parkinsonian signs.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the X chromosome is associated with sex-specific cognitive change and tau pathology in aging and AD. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: This study examined differential gene expression profiling of the X chromosome from an RNA sequencing data set of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex obtained from autopsied, elderly individuals enrolled in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project joint cohorts. Samples were collected from the cohort study with enrollment from 1994 to 2017. Data were last analyzed in May 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main analysis examined whether X chromosome gene expression measured by RNA sequencing of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was associated with cognitive change during aging and AD, independent of AD pathology and at the transcriptome-wide level in women and men. Whether X chromosome gene expression was associated with neurofibrillary tangle burden, a measure of tau pathology that influences cognition, in women and men was also explored. RESULTS: Samples for RNA sequencing of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were obtained from 508 individuals (mean [SD] age at death, 88.4 [6.6] years; 315 [62.0%] were female; 197 [38.8%] had clinical diagnosis of AD at death; 293 [58.2%] had pathological diagnosis of AD at death) enrolled in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project joint cohorts and were followed up annually for a mean (SD) of 6.3 (3.9) years.

The variations of MRI measurements due to differences in magnetic field strength, image acquisition protocols, and scanner vendors can influence the interpretation of aggregated data.

METHODS: We proposed a bootstrap resampling method using individual participant data and compared it with two common random effects meta-analysis methods, DerSimonian-Laird and Hartung-Knapp, and a conventional pooling method that combines MRI data from different scanners. We first performed simulations to compare the power and coverage probabilities of the four methods in the absence and presence of scanner effects on measurements. We then examined the association of age with white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes from 787 participants. RESULTS: In simulations, the bootstrap approach performed better than the other three methods in terms of coverage probability and power when scanner differences were present.

OBJECTIVE: This study grouped older adults based on their baseline cognitive profiles using a latent variable approach and tested the hypothesis that these groups would differ in their subsequent trajectories of cognitive change. METHODS: In this study we applied time-varying effects models (TVEMs) to examine the longitudinal trajectories of cognitive decline across different subgroups of older adults in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. RESULTS: A total of 1,662 individuals (mean age = 79.6 years, SD = 7.4, 75.4%female) participated in the study; these were categorized into five previously identified classes of older adults differing in their baseline cognitive profiles: Superior Cognition (n = 328, 19.7%), Average Cognition (n = 767, 46.1%), Mixed-Domains Impairment (n = 71, 4.3%), Memory-Specific Impairment (n = 274, 16.5%), and Frontal Impairment (n = 222, 13.4%). Differences in the trajectories of cognition for these five classes persisted during 8 years of follow-up. Compared with the Average Cognition class, The Mixed-Domains and Memory-Specific Impairment classes showed steeper rates of decline, while other classes showed moderate declines.

Measures of financial and healthcare decision making and early life SES were collected, along with demographics, global cognition, and financial and health literacy. RESULTS: Early life SES was positively associated with decision making (estimate = 0.218, p = 0.027), after adjustments for demographic covariates and global cognition, such that a one-unit increase in early life SES was equivalent to the effect of being four years younger in age as it pertains to decision making.

Eighty-six participants developed incident HF, and the mean onset time was 5.7 years (SD, 3.4; range, 1-14). Participants who napped longer than 44.4 minutes (ie, the median daily napping duration) showed a 1.73-fold higher risk of developing incident HF than participants who napped <44.4 minutes.

In-vivo measures included cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) synaptic proteins (synaptotagmin-1, SNAP-25, neurogranin, and GAP-43), Aβ42/40, ptau181, and MRI gray matter volume (GMV). Postmortem measures captured brain tissue levels of presynaptic proteins (complexin-I, complexin-II, VAMP, and SNARE complex), and neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) counts.

We tested whether dysregulation of cholesterol catabolism, through its conversion to primary bile acids (BAs), was associated with dementia pathogenesis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a 3-step study design to examine the role of the primary BAs, cholic acid (CA), and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) as well as their principal biosynthetic precursor, 7α-hydroxycholesterol (7α-OHC), in dementia. In Step 1, we tested whether serum markers of cholesterol catabolism were associated with brain amyloid accumulation, white matter lesions (WMLs), and brain atrophy. In Step 2, we tested whether exposure to bile acid sequestrants (BAS) was associated with risk of dementia. In Step 3, we examined plausible mechanisms underlying these findings by testing whether brain levels of primary BAs and gene expression of their principal receptors are altered in AD. Step 1: We assayed serum concentrations CA, CDCA, and 7α-OHC and used linear regression and mixed effects models to test their associations with brain amyloid accumulation (N = 141), WMLs, and brain atrophy (N = 134) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). The BLSA is an ongoing, community-based cohort study that began in 1958. Participants in the BLSA neuroimaging sample were approximately 46% male with a mean age of 76 years; longitudinal analyses included an average of 2.5 follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) visits. We used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (N = 1,666) to validate longitudinal neuroimaging results in BLSA. ADNI is an ongoing, community-based cohort study that began in 2003. Participants were approximately 55% male with a mean age of 74 years; longitudinal analyses included an average of 5.2 follow-up MRI visits. Lower serum concentrations of 7α-OHC, CA, and CDCA were associated with higher brain amyloid deposition (p = 0.041), faster WML accumulation (p = 0.050), and faster brain atrophy mainly (false discovery rate [FDR] p = <0.001-0.013) in males in BLSA. In ADNI, we found a modest sex-specific effect indicating that lower serum concentrations of CA and CDCA were associated with faster brain atrophy (FDR p = 0.049) in males.Step 2: In the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) dataset, covering >4 million registrants from general practice clinics in the United Kingdom, we tested whether patients using BAS (BAS users; 3,208 with ≥2 prescriptions), which reduce circulating BAs and increase cholesterol catabolism, had altered dementia risk compared to those on non-statin lipid-modifying therapies (LMT users; 23,483 with ≥2 prescriptions). Patients in the study (BAS/LMT) were approximately 34%/38% male and with a mean age of 65/68 years; follow-up time was 4.7/5.7 years. We found that BAS use was not significantly associated with risk of all-cause dementia (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.72-1.46, p = 0.88) or its subtypes. We found a significant difference between the risk of VaD in males compared to females (p = 0.040) and a significant dose-response relationship between BAS use and risk of VaD (p-trend = 0.045) in males.Step 3: We assayed brain tissue concentrations of CA and CDCA comparing AD and control (CON) samples in the BLSA autopsy cohort (N = 29). Participants in the BLSA autopsy cohort (AD/CON) were approximately 50%/77% male with a mean age of 87/82 years. We analyzed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq) data to compare brain BA receptor gene expression between AD and CON samples from the Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP) cohort (N = 46). ROSMAP is an ongoing, community-based cohort study that began in 1994. Participants (AD/CON) were approximately 56%/36% male with a mean age of 85/85 years. In BLSA, we found that CA and CDCA were detectable in postmortem brain tissue samples and were marginally higher in AD samples compared to CON. In ROSMAP, we found sex-specific differences in altered neuronal gene expression of BA receptors in AD. Study limitations include the small sample sizes in the BLSA cohort and likely inaccuracies in the clinical diagnosis of dementia subtypes in primary care settings. CONCLUSIONS: We combined targeted metabolomics in serum and amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and MRI of the brain with pharmacoepidemiologic analysis to implicate dysregulation of cholesterol catabolism in dementia pathogenesis. We observed that lower serum BA concentration mainly in males is associated with neuroimaging markers of dementia, and pharmacological lowering of BA levels may be associated with higher risk of VaD in males. We hypothesize that dysregulation of BA signaling pathways in the brain may represent a plausible biologic mechanism underlying these results. Together, our observations suggest a novel mechanism relating abnormalities in cholesterol catabolism to risk of dementia.",2021-05,e1003615,PLoS Med,PubMed,PMID: 34043628 PMCID: PMC8158920,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34043628,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Gene Expression Profiling; United Kingdom; Dementia; Incidence; Metabolomics; Bile Acids and Salts; Pharmacoepidemiology",

PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand five hundred fifty-eight older adults initially free of dementia underwent assessments of purpose in life and detailed annual clinical evaluations to document incident Alzheimer's dementia and mortality. General accelerated failure time models examined the relation of baseline purpose in life with age at Alzheimer's dementia diagnosis and mortality. EXPOSURES: Purpose in life was assessed at baseline. MAIN OUTCOMES: Alzheimer's dementia diagnosis was documented annually based on detailed clinical evaluations and mortality was documented via regular contacts and annual evaluations.

METHODS: Nondemented older adults (N = 1175) underwent annual testing with 17 cognitive tests summarized as a global cognitive score. A composite sarcopenia score was constructed based on muscle mass measured with bioelectrical impedance and muscle function based on grip strength. Cox proportional hazard models were employed to examine associations of sarcopenia with incident Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Linear mixed-effect models determined the association of sarcopenia with cognitive decline. All models controlled for age, sex, education, race, and height squared. RESULTS: Average follow-up was 5.6 years. More severe sarcopenia at baseline was associated with a higher risk of incident AD (hazard ratio [HR], 1.50 [95% confidence interval 1.20-1.86]; p < 0.001) and of MCI (1.21 [1.01-1.45]; 0.04) and a faster rate of cognitive decline (estimate = -0.013; p = 0.01). Analyses of the individual components of sarcopenia showed that muscle function was associated with incident AD, incident MCI, and cognitive decline with and without a term for lean muscle mass in the model. In contrast, lean muscle mass was not associated with incident cognitive impairment or cognitive decline when a term for muscle function was included in the model.

A relationship between LATE-NC and arteriolosclerosis has been reported in some but not all studies. The objectives of this study were to investigate the frequency of co-occurring LATE-NC and microvascular pathologies and test the hypothesis that arteriolosclerosis, specifically, is related to LATE-NC in brains from community-dwelling older persons. Analyses included 749 deceased participants with completed data on LATE-NC and microvascular pathology from 3 longitudinal clinical pathologic studies of aging. Given the specific interest in arteriolosclerosis, we expanded the examination of arteriolosclerosis to include not only the basal ganglia but also two additional white matter regions from anterior and posterior watershed territories. Ordinal logistic regression models examined the association of microvascular pathology with LATE-NC. LATE-NC was present in 409 (54.6%) decedents, of which 354 (86.5%) had one or multiple microvascular pathologies including 132 (32.3%) with moderate-severe arteriolosclerosis in basal ganglia, 195 (47.6%) in anterior watershed, and 144 (35.2%) in posterior watershed; 170 (41.5%) with moderate-severe CAA, and 150 (36.6%) with microinfarcts.

To gain insights into proteins and pathways associated with Lewy body pathology, we performed quantitative profiling of the proteome. We analyzed substantia nigra tissue from 51 subjects arranged into three groups: cases with Lewy body pathology, Lewy body-negative controls with matching neuronal loss, and controls with no neuronal loss. Using a label-free liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) approach, we characterized the proteome both in terms of protein abundances and peptide modifications. Statistical testing for differential abundance of the most abundant 2963 proteins, followed by pathway enrichment and Bayesian learning of the causal network structure, was performed to identify likely drivers of Lewy body formation and dopaminergic neuronal loss. The identified pathways include (1) Arp2/3 complex-mediated actin nucleation; (2) synaptic function; (3) poly(A) RNA binding; (4) basement membrane and endothelium; and (5) hydrogen peroxide metabolic process. According to the data, the endothelial/basement membrane pathway is tightly connected with both pathologies and likely to be one of the drivers of neuronal loss.

TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions, evaluated in 6 brain regions using immunohistochemistry, were used to obtain a semiquantitative TDP-43 score (0-5) in each region, and scores were averaged across regions to obtain a TDP-43 severity score. We used linear regressions to test the association of DM and A1C with the TDP-43 severity score. RESULTS: On average, participants (n=817) were 90 years old at the time of death, three fourth were women, and one fourth had DM. The mean A1C was 6.0% (SD=0.6).

Epistasis has been considered as one of the main causes of ""missing heritability"" in AD. METHODS: We performed genome-wide epistasis screening (N = 10,389) for the clinical diagnosis of AD using three popularly adopted methods. Subsequent analyses were performed to eliminate spurious associations caused by possible confounding factors. Then, candidate genetic interactions were examined for their co-expression in the brains of AD patients and analyzed for their association with intermediate AD phenotypes. Moreover, a new approach was developed to compile the epistasis risk factors into an epistasis risk score (ERS) based on multifactor dimensional reduction. Two independent datasets were used to evaluate the feasibility of ERSs in AD risk prediction. RESULTS: We identified 2 candidate genetic interactions with PFDR <  0.05 (RAMP3-SEMA3A and NSMCE1-DGKE/C17orf67) and another 5 genetic interactions with PFDR <  0.1. Co-expression between the identified interactions supported the existence of possible biological interactions underlying the observed statistical significance. Further association of candidate interactions with intermediate phenotypes helps explain the mechanisms of neuropathological alterations involved in AD. Importantly, we found that ERSs can identify high-risk individuals showing earlier onset of AD.

Within a test dataset lacking transcriptomic data, traditional two-stage TWAS methods first impute gene expression by creating a weighted sum that aggregates SNPs with their corresponding cis-eQTL effects on reference transcriptome. Traditional TWAS methods then employ a linear regression model to assess the association between imputed gene expression and test phenotype, thereby assuming the effect of a cis-eQTL SNP on test phenotype is a linear function of the eQTL's estimated effect on reference transcriptome. To increase TWAS robustness to this assumption, we propose a novel Variance-Component TWAS procedure (VC-TWAS) that assumes the effects of cis-eQTL SNPs on phenotype are random (with variance proportional to corresponding reference cis-eQTL effects) rather than fixed. VC-TWAS is applicable to both continuous and dichotomous phenotypes, as well as individual-level and summary-level GWAS data.

The discovery of novel AD-associated genetic variants, particularly in coding regions and from APOE ε4 non-carriers, is critical for understanding the pathology of AD. In this study, we carried out an exome-wide association analysis of age-of-onset of AD with ~20,000 subjects and placed more emphasis on APOE ε4 non-carriers. Using Cox mixed-effects models, we find that age-of-onset shows a stronger genetic signal than AD case-control status, capturing many known variants with stronger significance, and also revealing new variants. We identified two novel variants, rs56201815, a rare synonymous variant in ERN1, and rs12373123, a common missense variant in SPPL2C in the MAPT region in APOE ε4 non-carriers. Besides, a rare missense variant rs144292455 in TACR3 showed the consistent direction of effect sizes across all studies with a suggestive significant level. In an attempt to unravel their regulatory and biological functions, we found that the minor allele of rs56201815 was associated with lower average FDG uptake across five brain regions in ADNI. Our eQTL analyses based on 6198 gene expression samples from ROSMAP and GTEx revealed that the minor allele of rs56201815 was potentially associated with elevated expression of ERN1, a key gene triggering unfolded protein response (UPR), in multiple brain regions, including the posterior cingulate cortex and nucleus accumbens. Our cell-type-specific eQTL analysis using ~80,000 single nuclei in the prefrontal cortex revealed that the protective minor allele of rs12373123 significantly increased the expression of GRN in microglia, and was associated with MAPT expression in astrocytes. These findings provide novel evidence supporting the hypothesis of the potential involvement of the UPR to ER stress in the pathological pathway of AD, and also give more insights into underlying regulatory mechanisms behind the pleiotropic effects of rs12373123 in multiple degenerative diseases including AD and Parkinson's disease.",26/02/2021,146,Transl Psychiatry,PubMed,PMID: 33637690 PMCID: PMC7910483,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33637690,"Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Membrane Proteins; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alzheimer Disease; Apolipoprotein E4; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Endoribonucleases; Exome; Exome Sequencing; Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases",

RESULTS: In EA subjects, none of the GM or HLA alleles-individually or epistatically-were associated with time to development of AD. In AA subjects, GM and HLA alleles individually were not associated with time to development of AD. However, there was a significant interaction: In the presence of GM 3 (i.e., GM 3/3 and GM 3/17 subjects), the presence of the HLA-C allele was associated with a 4-fold increase in the likelihood of developing AD compared with its absence (hazard ratio [HR] 4.17, 95% CI, 1.28-13.58).

MCR is associated with increased risk of cognitive decline and incident dementia. Predictors of transition to dementia in MCR patients are still obscure. METHODS: We examined clinical, biological and lifestyle parameters related to conversion to dementia using Cox models in 439 older adults with prevalent MCR (mean age 79.87 ± 8.13 years, 70% women) from two cohorts, 268 from the Chicago-based Rush Memory and Aging project (MAP) and 171 from the Religious Orders Study (ROS), which enrolled religious clergy across the United States. RESULTS: In the pooled sample, 439 (13.2%) had prevalent MCR (268 MAP and 171 ROS). There were 140 (31.9%) incident dementia cases over a median follow up of 4.0 years. Age predicted conversion from MCR to dementia in both cohorts. Male gender was a risk factor only in ROS. In the pooled data, only higher depressive symptoms were associated with higher risk of conversion to dementia (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.13, 95% CI 1.03-1.24). Lower cognitive activity participation (aHR 0.59, 95% CI 0.44-0.79) and apolipoprotein E ε4 allele (aHR 2.57, 95% CI 1.48-4.45) predicted conversion to dementia in MAP.

Prior work estimated that the three most studied of these, Alzheimer's disease, infarcts, and Lewy bodies, account for ∼40% of the variation in late life cognitive decline. However, that estimate did not incorporate many other diseases that are now recognized as potent drivers of cognitive decline [e.g. limbic predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE-NC), hippocampal sclerosis, other cerebrovascular conditions]. We examined the degree to which person-specific cognitive decline in old age is driven by a wide array of neuropathologies. Deceased participants (n = 1164) from two longitudinal clinical-pathological studies, the Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study, completed up to 24 annual evaluations including 17 cognitive performance tests and underwent brain autopsy. Neuropathological examinations provided 11 pathological indices, including markers of Alzheimer's disease, non- Alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative diseases (i.e. LATE-NC, hippocampal sclerosis, Lewy bodies), and cerebrovascular conditions (i.e. macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis). Mixed effects models examined the linear relation of pathological indices with global cognitive decline, and random change point models examined the relation of the pathological indices with the onset of terminal decline and rates of preterminal and terminal decline. Cognition declined an average of about 0.10 unit per year (estimate = -0.101, SE = 0.003, P < 0.001) with considerable heterogeneity in rates of decline (variance estimate for the person-specific slope of decline was 0.0094, P < 0.001). When considered separately, 10 of 11 pathological indices were associated with faster decline and accounted for between 2% and 34% of the variation in decline, respectively. When considered simultaneously, the 11 pathological indices together accounted for 43% of the variation in decline; Alzheimer's disease-related indices accounted for 30-36% of the variation, non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegenerative indices 4-10%, and cerebrovascular indices 3-8%. Finally, the 11 pathological indices combined accounted for less than a third of the variation in the onset of terminal decline (28%) and rates of preterminal (32%) and terminal decline (19%). Although age-related neuropathologies account for a large proportion of the variation in late life cognitive decline, considerable variation remains unexplained even after considering a wide array of neuropathologies.

We aimed to identify key components within the presynaptic SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) machinery associated with cognitive performance and estimate their potential contribution to brain reserve in old age. We used targeted SRM proteomics to quantify amounts of 60 peptides, encoded in 30 different genes, in postmortem specimens of the prefrontal cortex from 1209 participants of two aging studies, with available antemortem cognitive evaluations and postmortem neuropathologic assessments. We found that select (but not all) proteoforms are strongly associated with cognitive function and the burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Specifically, greater abundance of STX1A (but not other syntaxins), SYT12, full-length SNAP25, and the GABAergic STXBP1 variant were robustly associated with better cognitive performance. By contrast, greater abundance of other presynaptic proteins (e.g., STXBP5 or tomosyn, STX7, or SYN2) showed a negative influence on cognition. Regression models adjusting for demographic and pathologic variables showed that altered levels of these protein species explained 7.7% additional between-subject variance in cognition (more than any individual age-related neuropathology in the model), suggesting that these molecules constitute key elements of brain reserve. Network analyses indicated that those peptides associated with brain reserve, and closest to the SNARE fusogenic activity, showed greater centrality measures and were better connected in the network. Validation assays confirmed the selective loss of the STX1A (but not STX1B) isoform in cognitively impaired cases. In rodent and human brains, STX1A was selectively located at glutamatergic terminals. However, in AD brains, STX1A was redistributed adjacent to neuritic pathology, and markedly expressed in astrocytes. Our study provides strong evidence, indicating that select presynaptic proteins are key in maintaining brain reserve.

METHODS: This study examined parkinsonism, PD frequency, and cognition of community-dwelling older individuals in 3 longitudinal epidemiologic cohort studies. Parkinsonism was based on an exam utilizing the modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale performed by a nurse. PD was based on self-report, medications used for treatment of PD, and examination findings. Cognition was assessed using 19 performance-based tests that assess 5 cognitive domains. RESULTS: AA participants were less likely to have parkinsonism compared to Whites, even with age and gender differences. Frequency of PD was not significant between groups. AA were more likely to have lower cognitive scores as compared to Whites. AA were less likely to have parkinsonism even with controlling for cognitive differences between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Parkinsonian signs are present among AA in the community at lower rates than in White individuals.

This study investigated declining financial and health literacy in relation to decision making performance, scam susceptibility and psychological wellbeing. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. SETTING: A community-based cohort in Northeastern Illinois, USA. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand fourty-six older adults who were free of dementia at baseline and underwent annual clinical and literacy assessments. MEASUREMENTS: Financial and health literacy, decision making, scam susceptibility, and psychological wellbeing were assessed using validated instruments. Linear mixed effects models estimated person-specific rates of change in financial and health literacy, and multivariable regression analyses examined the associations of declining literacy with subsequent levels of decision making, scam susceptibility, and psychological wellbeing. RESULTS: The mean age was 81 years and 76% were female. Over up to 10 years of annual follow-ups, the average financial and health literacy score dropped 1 percentage point a year. Substantial variability in decline was observed between participants. Faster decline in financial and health literacy was associated with poorer decision making, higher scam susceptibility, and lower psychological wellbeing. Notably, these associations were above and beyond the baseline literacy level and persisted even after controlling for cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Most community-dwelling older adults experience decline in financial and health literacy over time, but decline is not inevitable.

Cerebral small vessel pathologies are associated with microinfarcts and frequently coexist with Alzheimer disease; however, the extent to which Aβ (amyloid beta) and tau pathology modulates microvascular pathogenesis is not fully understood. Study objective was to examine the relationship of small vessel pathologies, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy, with cortical microinfarcts in people with differing levels of Aβ or tau tangle burden. METHODS: Participants were 1489 autopsied older people (mean age at death, 89 years; 67% women) from 1 of 3 ongoing clinical-pathological cohort studies of aging. Neuropathological evaluation identified cortical Aβ and tau tangle burden using immunohistochemistry in 8 brain regions, provided semiquantitative grading of cerebral vessel pathologies, and identified the presence of cortical microinfarcts. Logistic regression models adjusted for demographics and atherosclerosis and examined whether Aβ or tau tangle burden modified relations between small vessel pathologies and cortical microinfarcts. RESULTS: Cortical microinfarcts were present in 17% of older people, moderate-to-severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy pathology in 36%, and arteriolosclerosis in 34%. In logistic regression models, we found interactions with Aβ and tau tangles, reflecting that the association between arteriolosclerosis and cortical microinfarcts was stronger in the context of greater Aβ (estimate, 0.15; SE=0.07; P=0.02) and tau tangle burden (estimate, 0.13; SE=0.06; P=0.02). Interactions also emerged for cerebral amyloid angiopathy, suggesting that the association between cerebral amyloid angiopathy and cortical microinfarcts is more robust in the presence of higher Aβ (estimate, 0.27; SE=0.07; P<0.001) and tangle burden (estimate, 0.16; SE=0.06; P=0.005).

BACKGROUND: Iron featured historically early in AD research efforts for its involvement in the amyloid and tau proteinopathies, APP processing, genetics, and one clinical trial, yet iron neurochemistry remains peripheral in mainstream AD research. Much of the effort investigating iron in AD has focused on the potential for iron to provoke the onset of disease, by promoting proteinopathy though increased protein expression, phosphorylation, and aggregation. NEW/UPDATED HYPOTHESIS: We provide new evidence from a large post mortem cohort that brain iron levels within the normal range were associated with accelerated ante mortem disease progression in cases with underlying proteinopathic neuropathology. These results corroborate recent findings that argue for an additional downstream role for iron as an effector of neurodegeneration, acting independently of tau or amyloid pathologies. We hypothesize that the level of tissue iron is a trait that dictates the probability of neurodegeneration in AD by ferroptosis, a regulated cell death pathway that is initiated by signals such as glutathione depletion and lipid peroxidation. MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR THE HYPOTHESIS: While clinical biomarkers of ferroptosis are still in discovery, the demonstration of additional ferroptotic correlates (genetic or biomarker derived) of disease progression is required to test this hypothesis. The genes implicated in familial AD are not known to influence ferroptosis, although recent reports on APP mutations and apolipoprotein E allele (APOE) have shown impact on cellular iron retention. Familial AD mutations will need to be tested for their impact on ferroptotic vulnerability. Ultimately, this hypothesis will be substantiated, or otherwise, by a clinical trial of an anti-ferroptotic/iron compound in AD patients. LINKAGE TO OTHER MAJOR THEORIES: Iron has historically been linked to the amyloid and tau proteinopathies of AD. Tau, APP, and apoE have been implicated in physiological iron homeostasis in the brain. Iron is biochemically the origin of most chemical radicals generated in biochemistry and thus closely associated with the oxidative stress theory of AD. Iron accumulation is also a well-established consequence of aging and inflammation, which are major theories of disease pathogenesis.",2021-07,1244-1256,Alzheimers Dement,PubMed,PMID: 33491917 PMCID: PMC9701539,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33491917,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Apolipoproteins E; cognitive decline; neurodegeneration; Phosphorylation; pathology; iron; Iron",

METHODS: 1466 community-dwelling older adults underwent assessment of muscle mass with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), grip strength, gait speed and other components of physical frailty and annual self-report assessments of disability. We used Cox proportional hazards models that controlled for age, sex, race, education and height to examine the associations of a continuous sarcopenia metric with the hazard of death and incident disabilities. RESULTS: Mean baseline age was about 80 years old and follow-up was 5.5 years. In a proportional hazards model controlling for age, sex, race, education and baseline sarcopenia, each 1-SD higher score on a continuous sarcopenia scale was associated with lower hazards of death (HR 0.70, 95%CI [0.62, 0.78]), incident IADL (HR 0.80,95%CI [0.70, 0.93]), incident ADL disability (HR 0.80 95%CI [71, 91]) and incident mobility disability (HR 0.81, 95%CI [0.70, 0.93]). Further analyses suggest that grip strength and gait speed rather than muscle mass drive the associations with all four adverse health outcomes. Similar findings were observed when controlling for additional measures used to assess physical frailty including BMI, fatigue and physical activity.

The latter is additionally supported by observations of pQTLs with large effects' tending to be rare, deleterious, and associated with proteins that have evidence for fewer protein-protein interactions. Mediation analyses using matched transcriptomic and proteomic data provided additional evidence that pQTL effects are often, but not always, mediated by mRNA.

METHODS: 867 community-dwelling older adults without mobility disability or parkinsonism at baseline were examined annually. Mobility disability was based on annual measured gait speed. Parkinsonism was based on the annual assessment of 26 items from the motor portion of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale.

Despite this disparity, the largest Alzheimer disease genome-wide association studies to date have been conducted in non-Hispanic White individuals. In the largest association analyses of Alzheimer disease in African American individuals, ABCA7, TREM2, and an intergenic locus at 5q35 were previously implicated. OBJECTIVE: To identify additional risk loci in African American individuals by increasing the sample size and using the African Genome Resource panel. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This genome-wide association meta-analysis used case-control and family-based data sets from the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium. There were multiple recruitment sites throughout the United States that included individuals with Alzheimer disease and controls of African American ancestry. Analysis began October 2018 and ended September 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Diagnosis of Alzheimer disease. RESULTS: A total of 2784 individuals with Alzheimer disease (1944 female [69.8%]) and 5222 controls (3743 female [71.7%]) were analyzed (mean [SD] age at last evaluation, 74.2 [13.6] years). Associations with 4 novel common loci centered near the intracellular glycoprotein trafficking gene EDEM1 (3p26; P = 8.9 × 10-7), near the immune response gene ALCAM (3q13; P = 9.3 × 10-7), within GPC6 (13q31; P = 4.1 × 10-7), a gene critical for recruitment of glutamatergic receptors to the neuronal membrane, and within VRK3 (19q13.33; P = 3.5 × 10-7), a gene involved in glutamate neurotoxicity, were identified. In addition, several loci associated with rare variants, including a genome-wide significant intergenic locus near IGF1R at 15q26 (P = 1.7 × 10-9) and 6 additional loci with suggestive significance (P ≤ 5 × 10-7) such as API5 at 11p12 (P = 8.8 × 10-8) and RBFOX1 at 16p13 (P = 5.4 × 10-7) were identified. Gene expression data from brain tissue demonstrate association of ALCAM, ARAP1, GPC6, and RBFOX1 with brain β-amyloid load. Of 25 known loci associated with Alzheimer disease in non-Hispanic White individuals, only APOE, ABCA7, TREM2, BIN1, CD2AP, FERMT2, and WWOX were implicated at a nominal significance level or stronger in African American individuals. Pathway analyses strongly support the notion that immunity, lipid processing, and intracellular trafficking pathways underlying Alzheimer disease in African American individuals overlap with those observed in non-Hispanic White individuals. A new pathway emerging from these analyses is the kidney system, suggesting a novel mechanism for Alzheimer disease that needs further exploration. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: While the major pathways involved in Alzheimer disease etiology in African American individuals are similar to those in non-Hispanic White individuals, the disease-associated loci within these pathways differ.",01/01/2021,102-113,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 33074286 PMCID: PMC7573798,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33074286,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alzheimer Disease; Black or African American; Genetic Loci,

This study aims to identify the factors associated with scam susceptibility in older Black adults. METHODS: Participants were 383 older Black adults living in the Chicago metropolitan area (mean age = 78 years and 82% female). A scam susceptibility measure assessed perceptions and behaviors that predispose older adults to fraud and scams. Categories of age-associated factors, including cognition, physical health, psychosocial factors, personality, and behavioral economics, were measured using uniform systematic assessments. For each category separately, measures associated with scam susceptibility were identified via stepwise variable selection. RESULTS: Older age was associated with greater scam susceptibility. Further, the analysis revealed a robust association of cognitive health with scam susceptibility, particularly the domains of semantic and working memory. Psychological well-being was associated with susceptibility, as was neuroticism. Behavioral economic measures including financial and health literacy and financial and health decision-making ability were also implicated. In a final model that included all the measures initially retained by variable selection, semantic memory, psychological well-being, and financial and health literacy were independently associated with scam susceptibility. Moreover, the association of age was attenuated and no longer significant after adjusting for these correlates. DISCUSSION: Age-associated vulnerabilities, rather than age itself, predispose older Black adults to financial fraud and scams. The correlates of scam susceptibility in community-living older Black adults primarily involve cognitive health, psychological, and behavioral economic factors.",2021,729-739,Gerontology,PubMed,PMID: 33882498 PMCID: PMC9125480,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33882498,Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Age Factors; Cognition; Independent Living; Neuroticism; Health Literacy; Scam susceptibility; Fraud; Cognitive health; Financial and health literacy; Psychological well-being,

Clinical,2213-1582,10.1016/j.nicl.2021.102768,"Brain arteriolosclerosis, one of the main pathologies of cerebral small vessel disease, is common in older adults and has been linked to lower cognitive and motor function and higher odds of dementia. In spite of its frequency and associated morbidity, arteriolosclerosis can only be diagnosed at autopsy. Therefore, the purpose of this work was to develop an in-vivo classifier of arteriolosclerosis based on brain MRI. First, an ex-vivo classifier of arteriolosclerosis was developed based on features related to white matter hyperintensities, diffusion anisotropy and demographics by applying machine learning to ex-vivo MRI and pathology data from 119 participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) and Religious Orders Study (ROS), two longitudinal cohort studies of aging that recruit non-demented older adults. The ex-vivo classifier showed good performance in predicting the presence of arteriolosclerosis, with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve AUC = 0.78. The ex-vivo classifier was then translated to in-vivo based on available in-vivo and ex-vivo MRI data on the same participants. The in-vivo classifier was named ARTS (short for ARTerioloSclerosis), is fully automated, and provides a score linked to the likelihood a person suffers from arteriolosclerosis. The performance of ARTS in predicting the presence of arteriolosclerosis in-vivo was tested in a separate, 91% dementia-free group of 79 MAP/ROS participants and exhibited an AUC = 0.79 in persons with antemortem intervals shorter than 2.4 years. This level of performance in mostly non-demented older adults is notable considering that arteriolosclerosis can only be diagnosed at autopsy. The scan-rescan reproducibility of the ARTS score was excellent, with an intraclass correlation of 0.99, suggesting that application of ARTS in longitudinal studies may show high sensitivity in detecting small changes. Finally, higher ARTS scores in non-demented older adults were associated with greater decline in cognition two years after baseline MRI, especially in perceptual speed which has been linked to arteriolosclerosis and small vessel disease. This finding was shown in a separate group of 369 non-demented MAP/ROS participants and was validated in 72 non-demented Black participants of the Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) and also in 244 non-demented participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 2 and 3. The results of this work suggest that ARTS may have broad implications in the advancement of diagnosis, prevention and treatment of arteriolosclerosis.

N-glycosylation is the most common form of glycosylation, and the N-glycan moieties play key roles in regulating protein functions and many other biological processes. Thus, identification and quantification of N-glycome (complete repertoire of all N-glycans in a sample) may provide new sources of biomarkers and shed light on health and disease. To date, little is known about the role of altered N-glycome in Alzheimer's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease-related Dementias (AD/ADRD). The current study included 45 older adults who had no cognitive impairment (NCI) at baseline, followed and examined annually, and underwent brain autopsy after death. During about 12-year follow-up, 15 developed mild cognitive impairment (MCI), 15 developed AD, and 15 remained NCI. Relative abundances of N-glycans in serum at 2 time points (baseline and proximate to death, ∼12.3 years apart) and postmortem brain tissue (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) were quantified using MALDI-TOF-MS. Regression models were used to test the associations of N-glycans with AD/ADRD phenotypes. We detected 71 serum and 141 brain N-glycans, of which 46 were in common. Most serum N-glycans had mean fold changes less than one between baseline and proximate to death. The cross-tissue N-glycan correlations were weak. Baseline serum N-glycans were more strongly associated with AD/ADRD compared to change in serum N-glycans over time and brain N-glycans. The N-glycan associations were observed in both AD and non-AD neuropathologies. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive glycomic analysis in both blood and brain in relation to AD pathology.

Cross-sectional models tested the relationship between average PA and pathology, and the moderating effect of baseline PA on the association between pathology and cognition. Longitudinal models examined whether changes in PA moderated associations between pathology and cognition. RESULTS: PA was negatively associated with Lewy body disease (LBD), but positively associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) burdens. Baseline PA attenuated the association between cerebrovascular pathology and cognition, whereas longitudinal change in PA attenuated associations between AD, cerebral amyloid angiopathy, TAR DNA-binding protein 43, and atherosclerosis on cognitive decline.

This study examined to what extent varied motor performances are differentially associated with incident Alzheimer's dementia (AD) and incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in older adults. Design: Nested substudy. Setting: Communities across metropolitan Chicago. Participants: African American (N = 580) and European American (N = 580) adults without dementia, propensity-balanced by age (mean = 73.2; SD = 6.0), sex (78.4% women), education (mean = 15.6; SD = 3.3) and number of follow ups. Measurements: Cognitive status was assessed annually and based in part on a composite measure of global cognition including 17 cognitive tests. A global motor score was based on 10 motor performances from which 4 motor domains were computed including hand dexterity, hand strength, gait function, and leg strength. Results: During 7 years of follow-up, 166 of 1,160 (14.3%) developed AD. In a proportional hazards model controlling for age, sex, education, and race, each 1-SD higher baseline global motor score was associated with about a 20% reduction in the risk of AD (hazard ratio: 0.81; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.97). Higher baseline motor function was also associated with decreased risk of incident MCI (hazard ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.92).

METHODS: Participants (N = 318) were older adults from the Rush Memory and Aging Project who wore a device to quantify physical activity and also underwent detailed cognitive and motor testing. Following death, cerebral hemispheres underwent MRI to quantify the transverse relaxation rate R2, a metric related to tissue microstructure. For analyses, we reduced the dimensionality of the R2 maps from approximately 500,000 voxels to 30 components using spatial independent component analysis (ICA). Via path analysis, we examined whether these R2 components attenuated the association between physical activity and cognition, controlling for motor abilities and indices of common brain pathologies. RESULTS: Two of the 30 R2 components were associated with both total daily physical activity and global cognition assessed proximate to death. We visualized these components by highlighting the clusters of voxels whose R2 values contributed most strongly to each. One of these spatial signatures spanned periventricular white matter and hippocampus, while the other encompassed white matter of the occipital lobe. These two R2 components partially mediated the association between physical activity and cognition, accounting for 12.7% of the relationship (p = .01). This mediation remained evident after controlling for motor abilities and neurodegenerative and vascular brain pathologies.

We measured indoor mobility using room-to-room transitions, tested their psychometric properties, and correlated indoor mobility with cognitive and functional status. Materials and Methods: Community-dwelling older adults living alone (n = 139; age = 78.1 ± 8.6 years) from the Oregon Center for Aging & Technology (ORCATECH) and Minority Aging Research Study (MARS) were included in the study. Two indoor mobility features were developed using non-parametric parameters (frequency; stability): Indoor mobility frequency (room-to-room transitions/day) was detected using passive infrared (PIR) motion sensors fixed on the walls in four geographic locations (bathroom; bedroom; kitchen; living room) and using door contact sensors attached to the egress door in the entrance. Indoor mobility stability was estimated by variances of number of room-to-room transitions over a week. Test-retest reliability (Intra-class coefficient, ICC) and the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined as the standard error of measurement (SEM) were generated. Generalized estimating equations models related mobility features with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and functional status (gait speed). Results: An average of 206 days (±127) of sensor data were analyzed per individual. Indoor mobility frequency and stability showed good to excellent test-retest reliability (ICCs = 0.91[0.88-0.94]; 0.59[0.48-0.70]). The MCIDs of mobility frequency and mobility stability were 18 and 0.09, respectively. On average, a higher indoor mobility frequency was associated with faster gait speed (β = 0.53, p = 0.04), suggesting an increase of 5.3 room-to-room transitions per day was associated with an increase of 10 cm/s gait speed. A decrease in mobility stability was associated with MCI (β = -0.04, p = 0.03). Discussion: Mobility frequency and stability in the home are clinically meaningful and reliable features.

Healthy Longevity,2666-7568,10.1016/s2666-7568(20)30015-5,"BACKGROUND: Circadian disturbances are commonly seen in people with Alzheimer's disease and have been reported in individuals without symptoms of dementia but with Alzheimer's pathology. We aimed to assess the temporal relationship between circadian disturbances and Alzheimer's progression. METHODS: We did a prospective cohort study of 1401 healthy older adults (aged >59 years) enrolled in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL, USA) who had been followed up for up to 15 years. Participants underwent annual assessments of cognition (with a battery of 21 cognitive performance tests) and motor activities (with actigraphy). Four measures were extracted from actigraphy to quantify daily and circadian rhythmicity, which were amplitude of 24-h activity rhythm, acrophase (representing peak activity time), interdaily stability of 24-h activity rhythm, and intradaily variability for hourly fragmentation of activity rhythm. We used Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regressions to assess whether circadian disturbances predict an increased risk of incident Alzheimer's dementia and conversion of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia. We used linear mixed-effects models to investigate how circadian rhythms changed longitudinally and how the change integrated to Alzheimer's progression. FINDINGS: Participants had a median age of 81·8 (IQR 76·3-85·7) years. Risk of developing Alzheimer's dementia was increased with lower amplitude (1 SD decrease, hazard ratio [HR] 1·39, 95% CI 1·19-1·62) and higher intradaily variability (1 SD increase, 1·22, 1·04-1·43). In participants with mild cognitive impairment, increased risk of Alzheimer's dementia was predicted by lower amplitude (1 SD decrease, HR 1·46, 95% CI 1·24-1·72), higher intradaily variability (1 SD increase, 1·36, 1·15-1·60), and lower interdaily stability (1 SD decrease, 1·21, 1·02-1·44). A faster transition to Alzheimer's dementia in participants with mild cognitive impairment was predicted by lower amplitude (1 SD decrease, odds ratio [OR] 2·08, 95% CI 1·53-2·93), increased intradaily variability (1 SD increase, 1·97, 1·43-2·79), and decreased interdaily stability (1 SD decrease, 1·35, 1·01-1·84). Circadian amplitude, acrophase, and interdaily stability progressively decreased over time, and intradaily variability progressively increased over time. Alzheimer's progression accelerated these aging effects by doubling or more than doubling the annual changes in these measures after the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment, and further doubled them after the diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia. The longitudinal change of global cognition positively correlated with the longitudinal changes in amplitude and interdaily stability and negatively correlated with the longitudinal change in intradaily variability.

However, the underlying mechanisms have not yet been clearly established in humans. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prospective association between intakes of total and individual carotenoids and risk of incident Alzheimer dementia (AD) and explore the underlying neuropathological basis. METHODS: Among 927 participants from the Rush Memory and Aging Project who were free from AD at baseline and were followed up for a mean of 7 y, we estimated HRs for AD using Cox proportional hazards models by intakes of energy-adjusted carotenoids. Brain AD neuropathology was assessed in postmortem brain autopsies among 508 deceased participants. We used linear regression to assess the association of carotenoid intake with AD-related neuropathology. RESULTS: Higher intake of total carotenoids was associated with substantially lower hazard of AD after controlling for age, sex, education, ApoE-ε4, participation in cognitively stimulating activities, and physical activity level. Comparing the top and bottom quintiles (median intake: 24.8 compared with 6.7 mg/d) of total carotenoids, the multivariate HR (95% CI) was 0.52 (0.33, 0.81), P-trend < 0.01. A similar association was observed for lutein-zeaxanthin, a weaker linear inverse association was observed for β-carotene, and a marginally significant linear inverse association was found for β-cryptoxanthin. Among the deceased participants, consumers of higher total carotenoids (top compared with bottom tertile, 18.2 compared with 8.2 mg/d) had less global AD pathology (b: -0.10; SE = 0.04; P-trend = 0.01). For individual carotenoids, lutein-zeaxanthin and lycopene were inversely associated with brain global pathology, whereas lutein-zeaxanthin showed additional inverse associations with AD diagnostic score, neuritic plaque severity, and neurofibrillary tangle density and severity.

OBJECTIVE: We examined whether the burden of vascular risk factors proximate to death is associated with amyloid-β and tau levels or modified their known association. METHODS: We examined the brains of 1, 585 participants from two longitudinal community-based studies of older adults. Amyloid-β and tau were quantified by postmortem examination. The burden of vascular risk factors was summarized by calculating the Framingham general cardiovascular risk score (FRS) proximate to death. Using linear regressions, we examined the association of the FRS with the amyloid-β and tau levels and examined if the FRS modified the association of the amyloid-β with tau. RESULTS: On average, participants were nearly 90 years old and two-thirds were women. The FRS was not associated with amyloid-β (Spearman r  = -0.00, p  = 0.918) or tau (r = 0.01, p = 0.701). However, the FRS as a whole (estimate = -0.022, SE = 0.008, p = 0.009), and specifically the systolic blood pressure (SBP) component (estimate = -0.033, SE = 0.012, p = 0.009), modified the association of the amyloid-β with tau. Further analysis showed that the association between amyloid-β and tau was stronger at lower levels of SBP. CONCLUSION: Late-life vascular risk scores were not related to postmortem levels of amyloid-β or tau. However, lower levels of vascular risk scores and SBP were associated with a stronger association between amyloid-β and tau.

Because one of the most common clinical presentations of early stage dementia is memory impairment, we examined the relationship of T2D with memory function, using the recently published scientific literature. RECENT FINDINGS: We conducted a structured review to identify studies of ""T2D and memory"" published since 2015. After review of the 129 articles retrieved, we identified 14 studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among the eight studies with a single assessment of memory function in time (mostly cross-sectional), six found an association of T2D with lower memory function, but mostly in select subgroups of persons. Separately, six studies included repeated measures of memory (longitudinal design). Four out of six longitudinal studies found that T2D was related with a faster decline in memory, while two did not. Among the four studies showing a relation with memory decline, two had sample sizes of 9000-10,000 persons. Further, three longitudinal studies controlled for hypertension and stroke as covariates, and results suggested that common vascular risk factors and diseases do not account for the relation. While mechanistic studies clearly support a role for cerebrovascular disease in the relation of T2D with cognition, emerging data suggest that insulin resistance in the brain itself may also play a role. Most, but not all, recently published studies suggest that T2D is associated with a lower level and faster decline in memory function. This association does not appear to be fully accounted for by common vascular processes. More research will clarify the mechanisms linking T2D to memory and dementia.",05/11/2020,64,Curr Neurol Neurosci Rep,PubMed,PMID: 33150490 PMCID: PMC10165718,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33150490,"Humans; Cognition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Memory; Cognition Disorders; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Type 2 diabetes",

METHODS: We used data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study of community-dwelling adults. A total of 701 participants (mean age 82.7, 71.2% female) completed baseline cognitive evaluations and underwent brain autopsy to identify pathologic Alzheimer disease (AD), TDP-43 inclusions (defining limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy [LATE]), and hippocampal sclerosis. The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease word list memory test immediate recall trials provided serial position scores, which index the proportion of words recalled from the beginning (primacy scores) and end (recency scores) of a word list. Binary and ordinal logistic regressions examined associations between serial position scores and neuropathologic outcomes. Secondary outcomes included Alzheimer dementia and mild cognitive impairment proximate to death. RESULTS: Primacy and recency scores were uncorrelated (r = 0.07). Each SD of better primacy score was associated with lower likelihood of neuropathologic changes (24% lower LATE, 31% lower pathologic AD, 37% lower hippocampal sclerosis). For pathologic AD, better baseline primacy scores were associated with a 36% lower likelihood of comorbidity with LATE or hippocampal sclerosis. Primacy scores better discriminated between clinical diagnoses proximate to death, including those with mild cognitive impairment compared to no impairment. Recency scores showed weaker or no associations. CONCLUSIONS: Primacy scores may be particularly sensitive markers of AD and related hippocampal neuropathologies.

Extensive literature provides evidence that physical activity (PA) delays the onset of cognitive impairment; however, it is unclear whether engaging in PA in older adulthood is sufficient to influence progression through cognitive status categories. METHOD: Applying a coordinated analysis approach, this project independently analyzed 14 longitudinal studies (NTotal = 52 039; mean baseline age across studies = 69.9-81.73) from North America and Europe using multistate survival models to estimate the impact of engaging in PA on cognitive status transitions (nonimpaired, mildly impaired, severely impaired) and death. Multinomial regression models were fit to estimate life expectancy (LE) based on American PA recommendations. Meta-analyses provided the pooled effect sizes for the role of PA on each transition and estimated LEs. RESULTS: Controlling for baseline age, sex, education, and chronic conditions, analyses revealed that more PA is significantly associated with decreased risk of transitioning from nonimpaired to mildly impaired cognitive functioning and death, as well as substantially longer LE. Results also provided evidence for a protective effect of PA after onset of cognitive impairment (eg, decreased risk of transitioning from mild-to-severe cognitive impairment; increased likelihood of transitioning backward from severe-to-mild cognitive impairment), though between-study heterogeneity suggests a less robust association.

We propose a Bayesian genome-wide TWAS (BGW-TWAS) method that leverages both cis- and trans-eQTL information for a TWAS. Our BGW-TWAS method is based on Bayesian variable selection regression, which not only accounts for cis- and trans-eQTL of the target gene but also enables efficient computation by using summary statistics from standard eQTL analyses. Our simulation studies illustrated that BGW-TWASs achieved higher power compared to existing TWAS methods that do not assess trans-eQTL information.

Methods and Results A total of 1480 older adults with no disabilities (mean age=79.32±7.38 years) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project were followed for up to 21 years. FGCRS at baseline was calculated and categorized into tertiles. Disability was assessed annually with activities of daily living. The number of CVDs was calculated by summing up the CVD events. Global cognitive function was assessed annually with a battery of 19 tests. Data were analyzed using the Cox model, linear mixed effects model, and mediation analysis. At the end of the follow-up, 713 (48.2%) participants developed disability. Compared with the lowest tertile of the FGCRS, the multiadjusted hazards ratios of disability were 1.34 (95% CI, 1.11-1.62) for the highest tertile. In addition, the highest FGCRS was associated with a change in activities of daily living score over time (β=0.057; 95% CI, 0.021-0.093). The association between FGCRS and change in activities of daily living was 13.8% mediated by the accumulation of CVDs and 25.1% by cognitive decline, respectively.

However, the association of low bone mass with incident disability and mortality is not well established. A sample of 738 participants in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) was evaluated at baseline for bone mineral density (BMD) using quantitative ultrasound at the calcaneus. An annual interview assessed basic activities of daily living (BADL), instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), mobility disability, and history of hip fracture. The associations between baseline BMD and risk of death; incident BADL, IADL, and mobility disability; and hip fracture were investigated using Cox hazard models, adjusting for age, sex, education, race, and body mass index (BMI). The robustness of our findings was evaluated by adjusting for confounding factors and health conditions including joint pain, musculoskeletal medications, smoking status, motor function, global cognition, falls, cardiovascular events, and diabetes. Participants were on average (mean ± SD) 80.9 ± 7.0 years old, 72% female, and 3.8% black, with a baseline BMI of 27.3 ± 5.4 kg/m2, and a baseline of BMD of 0.44 ± 0.14 g/cm2. In models adjusted for age, sex, education, race, and BMI, lower BMD was associated with a higher rate of death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.20; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.33), incident BADL disability (HR 1.20; 95% CI, 1.05-1.37), and hip fracture (HR 2.57; 95% CI, 1.72-3.82), but not of IADL disability (HR 1.00; 95% CI, 0.85-1.17) or mobility disability (HR 1.13; 95% CI, 0.97-1.32).

However, the relationship of EPVS with age-related neuropathologies is not well understood. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the neuropathologic correlates of EPVS in a large community-based cohort of older adults. The cognitive correlates of EPVS over and beyond those of other pathologies were also assessed. METHODS: This study included 654 older deceased and autopsied participants of 3 longitudinal community-based studies of aging that had available data on cognition, ex vivo brain magnetic resonance imaging, and detailed neuropathologic examination. EPVS seen on ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging were histologically validated. Experienced observers rated EPVS burden in ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging using a semiquantitative 4-level scale. Elastic-net regularized ordinal logistic regression was used to investigate associations of EPVS burden with age-related neuropathologies. Mixed-effects models of cognition controlling for neuropathologies, demographics, and clinical factors, were used to determine whether EPVS burden has additional contributions to cognitive decline. RESULTS: EPVS burden in the whole group was associated with gross infarcts (odds ratio=1.67, P=0.0017) and diabetes mellitus (odds ratio=1.73, P=0.004). When considering only nondemented participants (with mild or no cognitive impairment), EPVS burden was associated with gross infarcts (odds ratio=1.74, P=0.016) and microscopic infarcts (odds ratio=1.79, P=0.013). EPVS burden was associated with faster decline in visuospatial abilities (estimate=-0.009, P=0.028), in the whole group, as well as lower levels of semantic memory (estimate=-0.13, P=0.048) and visuospatial abilities (estimate=-0.11, P=0.016) at the time of death. CONCLUSIONS: EPVS and infarcts may share similar neurobiological pathways regardless of dementia status. EPVS burden is linked to diabetes mellitus independently of neuropathologies, extending recent findings in animal studies implicating diabetes mellitus in impairment of the glymphatic system. Finally, EPVS burden may reflect additional brain tissue injury that may contribute to cognitive decline, not captured with traditional neuropathologic measures.",2020-09,2825-2833,Stroke,PubMed,PMID: 32757750 PMCID: PMC7484322,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32757750,"Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Brain; aging; Nervous System Diseases; cognition; Longitudinal Studies; Cognitive Dysfunction; neuropathology; Aging; Memory; Neurologic Examination; Neuropsychological Tests; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Independent Living; Psychomotor Performance; Cerebral Infarction; Diabetes Complications; magnetic resonance imaging",

In aging and preclinical AD, men also show more cognitive deficits. Here, we show that the X chromosome affects AD-related vulnerability in mice expressing the human amyloid precursor protein (hAPP), a model of AD. XY-hAPP mice genetically modified to develop testicles or ovaries showed worse mortality and deficits than did XX-hAPP mice with either gonad, indicating a sex chromosome effect. To dissect whether the absence of a second X chromosome or the presence of a Y chromosome conferred a disadvantage on male mice, we varied sex chromosome dosage. With or without a Y chromosome, hAPP mice with one X chromosome showed worse mortality and deficits than did those with two X chromosomes. Thus, adding a second X chromosome conferred resilience to XY males and XO females. In addition, the Y chromosome, its sex-determining region Y gene (Sry), or testicular development modified mortality in hAPP mice with one X chromosome such that XY males with testicles survived longer than did XY or XO females with ovaries. Furthermore, a second X chromosome conferred resilience potentially through the candidate gene Kdm6a, which does not undergo X-linked inactivation. In humans, genetic variation in KDM6A was linked to higher brain expression and associated with less cognitive decline in aging and preclinical AD, suggesting its relevance to human brain health.

We conducted a set of experimental cell culture studies of gene regulation by micro RNAs (miRNAs), based on genome-wide transcriptome, proteome, and miRNA expression data from twenty postmortem samples of lateral amygdala from donors with known neuroticism scores. Using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and TargetScan, we identified a list of mRNA-protein-miRNA sets whose expression patterns were consistent with miRNA-based translational repression, as a function of trait anxiety. Here, we focused on one gene from that list, which is of particular translational significance in Psychiatry: synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) is the binding site of the anticonvulsant drug levetiracetam ((S)-α-Ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidineacetamide), which has shown promise in anxiety disorder treatments. We confirmed that SV2A is associated with neuroticism or anxiety using an original GWAS of a community cohort (N = 1,706), and cross-referencing a published GWAS of multiple cohorts (Ns ranging from 340,569 to 390,278). Postmortem amygdala expression profiling implicated three putative regulatory miRNAs to target SV2A: miR-133a, miR-138, and miR-218. Moving from association to experimental causal testing in cell culture, we used a luciferase assay to demonstrate that miR-133a and miR-218, but not miR-138, significantly decreased relative luciferase activity from the SV2A dual-luciferase construct. In human neuroblastoma cells, transfection with miR-133a and miR-218 reduced both endogenous SV2A mRNA and protein levels, confirming miRNA targeting of the SV2A gene. This study illustrates the utility of combining postmortem gene expression data with GWAS to guide experimental cell culture assays examining gene regulatory mechanisms that may contribute to complex human traits.

However, the metabolic perturbation behind the onset of AD remains unclear. In this study, we performed metabolite profiling in both brain (n = 109) and matching serum samples (n = 566) to identify differentially expressed metabolites and metabolic pathways associated with neuropathology and cognitive performance and to identify individuals at high risk of developing cognitive impairment. The abundances of 6 metabolites, glycolithocholate (GLCA), petroselinic acid, linoleic acid, myristic acid, palmitic acid, palmitoleic acid and the deoxycholate/cholate (DCA/CA) ratio, along with the dysregulation scores of 3 metabolic pathways, primary bile acid biosynthesis, fatty acid biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids showed significant differences across both brain and serum diagnostic groups (P-value < 0.05). Significant associations were observed between the levels of differential metabolites/pathways and cognitive performance, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuritic plaque burden. Metabolites abundances and personalized metabolic pathways scores were used to derive machine learning models, respectively, that could be used to differentiate cognitively impaired persons from those without cognitive impairment (median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.772 for the metabolite level model; median AUC = 0.731 for the pathway level model).

METHODS: Data came from 1,356 community-based older persons who completed detailed annual cognitive testing and systematic neuropathologic examination at autopsy to identify LATE-NC, ADNC, and other age-related pathologies. Persons were categorized into (0) a group without a pathologic diagnosis of LATE or ADNC (n = 378), (1) LATE-NC without ADNC (n = 91), (2) ADNC without LATE-NC (n = 535), and (3) mixed ADNC with LATE-NC (n = 352).

RESULTS: Compared to those without LATE-NC or ADNC, those with pure LATE-NC had a faster decline in global cognition (p = 0.025) and episodic memory (p = 0.002); however, compared to persons with pure ADNC, those with pure LATE-NC showed a slower decline.

METHODS: To detect synonymous variants modulating AD risk, we conducted a whole-genome sequencing study on 67 Caribbean Hispanic (CH) families multiply affected by AD. Identified disease-associated variants were further assessed in an independent cohort of CHs, expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data, brain autopsy data, and functional experiments. RESULTS: Rare synonymous variants in 4 genes (CDH23, SLC9A3R1, RHBDD2, and ITIH2) segregated with AD status in multiplex families and had a significantly higher frequency in these families compared with reference populations of similar ancestry. In comparison to subjects without dementia, expression of CDH23 (β = 0.53, p = 0.006) and SLC9A3R1 (β = 0.50, p = 0.02) was increased, and expression of RHBDD2 (β = -0.70, p = 0.02) decreased in individuals with AD at death. In line with this finding, increased expression of CDH23 (β = 0.26 ± 0.08, p = 4.9E-4) and decreased expression of RHBDD2 (β = -0.60 ± 0.12, p = 5.5E-7) were related to brain amyloid load (p = 0.0025). SLC9A3R1 expression was associated with burden of TDP43 pathology (β = 0.58 ± 0.17, p = 5.9E-4).

Using minigene splicing assays, the CDH23 and SLC9A3R1 variants affected splicing efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that CDH23, SLC9A3R1, RHBDD2, and possibly ITIH2, which are involved in synaptic function, the glutamatergic system, and innate immunity, contribute to AD etiology.

All analyses were run across all participants and repeated restricting the sample to individuals with unimpaired cognition to identify variants at the earliest stages of disease. As expected, all resilience metrics were genetically correlated with cognitive performance and education attainment traits (P-values < 2.5 × 10-20), and we observed novel correlations with neuropsychiatric conditions (P-values < 7.9 × 10-4). Notably, neither resilience metric was genetically correlated with clinical Alzheimer's disease (P-values > 0.42) nor associated with APOE (P-values > 0.13). In single variant analyses, we observed a genome-wide significant locus among participants with unimpaired cognition on chromosome 18 upstream of ATP8B1 (index single nucleotide polymorphism rs2571244, minor allele frequency = 0.08, P = 2.3 × 10-8). The top variant at this locus (rs2571244) was significantly associated with methylation in prefrontal cortex tissue at multiple CpG sites, including one just upstream of ATPB81 (cg19596477; P = 2 × 10-13). Overall, this comprehensive genetic analysis of resilience implicates a putative role of vascular risk, metabolism, and mental health in protection from the cognitive consequences of neuropathology, while also providing evidence for a novel resilience gene along the bile acid metabolism pathway. Furthermore, the genetic architecture of resilience appears to be distinct from that of clinical Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that a shift in focus to molecular contributors to resilience may identify novel pathways for therapeutic targets.",01/08/2020,2561-2575,Brain,PubMed,PMID: 32844198 PMCID: PMC7447518,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32844198,"Alzheimer’s disease; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genotype; Genome-Wide Association Study; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; GWAS; amyloid; Aging; Cognitive Reserve; resilience; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 18; reserve",

However, little is known about the epigenetic signature of MDD in brain tissue. This study aimed to investigate associations between brain tissue-based DNA methylation and late-life MDD. METHODS: We performed a brain epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of late-life MDD in 608 participants from the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROS/MAP) using DNA methylation profiles of the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex generated using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 Beadchip array. We also conducted an EWAS of MDD in each sex separately. RESULTS: We found epigenome-wide significant associations between brain tissue-based DNA methylation and late-life MDD. The most significant and robust association was found with altered methylation levels in the YOD1 locus (cg25594636, p value = 2.55 × 10-11; cg03899372, p value = 3.12 × 10-09; cg12796440, p value = 1.51 × 10-08, cg23982678, p value = 7.94 × 10-08). Analysis of differentially methylated regions (p value = 5.06 × 10-10) further confirmed this locus.

The distribution of these isoforms in different cell types, as well as their role in AD pathology still remains unclear. METHODS: Utilizing antibodies targeting specific BIN1 epitopes in human post-mortem tissue and analyzing mRNA expression data from purified microglia, we identified three isoforms expressed in neurons and astrocytes (isoforms 1, 2 and 3) and four isoforms expressed in microglia (isoforms 6, 9, 10 and 12). The abundance of selected peptides, which correspond to groups of BIN1 protein isoforms, was measured in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and their relation to neuropathological features of AD was assessed. RESULTS: Peptides contained in exon 7 of BIN1's N-BAR domain were found to be significantly associated with AD-related traits and, particularly, tau tangles. Decreased expression of BIN1 isoforms containing exon 7 is associated with greater accumulation of tangles and subsequent cognitive decline, with astrocytic rather than neuronal BIN1 being the more likely culprit. These effects are independent of the BIN1 AD risk variant.

We tested the hypothesis that the impact of individual pathologies associated with progressive parkinsonism differs among older adults. METHODS: Data were from 1089 decedents who had undergone annual clinical testing and autopsy. Parkinsonism was based on a modified United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Linear mixed-effects models were employed, to investigate the combinations of 9 pathologies related to progressive parkinsonism. Then we estimated the person-specific contributions of each pathology for progressive parkinsonism. RESULTS: The average participant showed 3 pathologies. Parkinson's disease (PD) and 4 cerebrovascular pathologies (macroinfarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy [CAA]), but not Alzheimer's disease, TDP-43, hippocampal sclerosis, and microinfarcts, were independently associated with progressive parkinsonism.

RESULTS: In a regression model adjusted for age, sex, and education, global cognition was associated with decision making (B = 2.43, SE = 0.14, p < .001) but loneliness was not (B = -0.04, SE = 0.11, p = .72). However, in a model including the interaction of loneliness with global cognition, the interaction was significant (B = 0.44, SE = 0.20, p = .03), such that the detrimental effect of loneliness on decision making was stronger when cognition was low. In secondary analyses examining the interaction of loneliness with 5 specific cognitive domains, the interaction between loneliness and working memory with decision making was significant (B = 0.35, SE = 0.15, p = .02). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results suggest that loneliness compromises healthcare and financial decision making among older adults with lower global cognition and, more specifically, lower working memory.",23/11/2020,1476-1484,Gerontologist,PubMed,PMID: 32574350 PMCID: PMC7681217,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574350,Aged; Cohort Studies; Humans; Cognition; Loneliness; Independent Living; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Working memory; Dual-processing theory; Reserve; Social vulnerability,

OBJECTIVE: To examine the underlying genetic basis for brain amyloidosis in the preclinical phase of Alzheimer disease. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In the first stage of this genetic association study, a meta-analysis was conducted using genetic and imaging data acquired from 6 multicenter cohort studies of healthy older individuals between 1994 and 2019: the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer Disease Study, the Berkeley Aging Cohort Study, the Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer's Prevention, the Biomarkers of Cognitive Decline Among Normal Individuals cohort, the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, and the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, which included Alzheimer disease and mild cognitive impairment. The second stage was designed to validate genetic observations using pathologic and clinical data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. Participants older than 50 years with amyloid positron emission tomographic (PET) imaging data and DNA from the 6 cohorts were included. The largest cohort, the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer Disease Study (n = 3154), was the PET screening cohort used for a secondary prevention trial designed to slow cognitive decline associated with brain amyloidosis. Six smaller, longitudinal cohort studies (n = 1160) provided additional amyloid PET imaging data with existing genetic data. The present study was conducted from March 29, 2019, to February 19, 2020. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: A genome-wide association study of PET imaging amyloid levels. RESULTS: From the 4314 analyzed participants (age, 52-96 years; 2478 participants [57%] were women), a novel locus for amyloidosis was noted within RBFOX1 (β = 0.61, P = 3 × 10-9) in addition to APOE. The RBFOX1 protein localized around plaques, and reduced expression of RBFOX1 was correlated with higher amyloid-β burden (β = -0.008, P = .002) and worse cognition (β = 0.007, P = .006) during life in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project cohort.

The genetic heterogeneity underlying common, complex diseases poses a major challenge for targeted therapies and the identification of novel disease-associated variants. Case-control approaches are often limited to examining a specific outcome in a group of heterogenous patients with different clinical characteristics. Here, we developed a novel approach to define relevant transcriptomic endophenotypes and stratify decedents based on molecular profiles in three independent human LOAD cohorts. By integrating post-mortem brain gene co-expression data from 2114 human samples with LOAD, we developed a novel quantitative, composite phenotype that can better account for the heterogeneity in genetic architecture underlying the disease. We used iterative weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to reduce data dimensionality and to isolate gene sets that are highly co-expressed within disease subtypes and represent specific molecular pathways. We then performed single variant association testing using whole genome-sequencing data for the novel composite phenotype in order to identify genetic loci that contribute to disease heterogeneity.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine whether cardiovascular risk burden assessed by the Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score (FGCRS) is associated with cognitive decline and structural brain differences. METHODS: Within the Rush Memory and Aging Project, 1,588 dementia-free participants (mean age: 79.5 years) were followed for up to 21 years. FGCRS was assessed at baseline and categorized into tertiles (lowest, middle, and highest).

The objectives of this study were to determine the association between the FMR1 gene gray zone expansions, AGG interspersions, and the presence of parkinsonism and motor and cognitive function in an elderly community-based population. METHODS: Automated FMR1 polymerase chain reaction was performed on existing samples from 2 longitudinal aging studies whose subjects agreed to brain donation. A detailed clinical evaluation including a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score, a composite score of global motor function, 17 cognitive tests summarized as a global measure of cognition, and neuropathological examination were obtained for genotyped participants. RESULTS: The average age of the population (n = 2362) was 85.9 ± 7.3 years, and average age at death was 88.6 ± 6.4 years (n = 1326), with 72% women. The prevalence of FMR1 gray zone alleles was 5.2% (122 of 2362). There was no difference between participants with gray zone expansions or those lacking AGG interspersions compared with normal participants in global cognition, global motor function, clinical diagnosis, or pathological changes.

METHODS: Older persons without dementia at study enrollment (n = 1,010) had annual cognitive testing for up to 24 years (mean = 9.9 years, standard deviation = 5.0), died, and underwent a neuropathologic examination to quantify 9 postmortem markers of common neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular conditions. To accommodate the heterogeneity in cognitive trajectories, we used functional mixed effects models, which allow individuals to have different patterns of cognitive decline under a unified model structure. RESULTS: In a functional mixed effects model, postmortem markers (Alzheimer disease pathology, Lewy bodies, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 pathology, hippocampal sclerosis, atherosclerosis, gross infarcts) were associated with global cognitive decline. Residual global cognitive decline after adjustment for neuropathologic burden was weakly related to age at death; it occurred in only about one-third of participants, mostly proximate to death. Results were comparable after eliminating the initial cognitive assessments to minimize retest learning or controlling for frailty proximate to death. Analyses were also conducted with composite measures of episodic memory and perceptual speed. Residual decline not attributable to neuropathologic burden was confined to a subset for each outcome and was most evident proximate to death. Age at death was unrelated to residual decline in episodic memory but was related to residual decline in perceptual speed. INTERPRETATION: Late life cognitive loss mainly reflects non-normative pathologic and mortality-related processes rather than normative age-related processes.

Brain donation for research is almost exclusively obtained from non-Latinx Whites of higher socioeconomic status in the United States. Despite persistent efforts, it has been difficult to obtain consent for brain donation among diverse participants. Hence, our understanding of Alzheimer's dementia and related disorders remains incomplete. The purpose of this methodological paper was to propose and outline a two-phase sequential mixed-methods research study design to identify barriers and facilitators of brain donation among diverse older adults. The first phase will consist of qualitative focus groups using a three (participant minority status: African American, Latinx, or White of lower income) by two (participant brain donation decision: consented or declined) design. The second phase will include statistical analyses of quantitative measures of existing data representing categories of variables that may be associated with decision making regarding brain donation. Next steps must include conducting qualitative focus groups and subsequent data analyses, resulting in overarching themes. Afterward, qualitative themes will be operationalized using quantitative variables for statistical analyses. This proposed study design can provide the foundation for developing and implementing effective and culturally competent survey instruments, educational tools, and intervention strategies in an effort to facilitate brain donation among diverse older adults.",2020,311-322,Exp Aging Res,PubMed,PMID: 32267801 PMCID: PMC7289682,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32267801,Humans; Middle Aged; Brain; Research Design; Hispanic or Latino; Surveys and Questionnaires; Aging; Black or African American; White People; Minority Groups; Tissue Donors; Focus Groups; Health Equity; Income,

An important aim of these studies is the identification of candidate genes that demonstrate congruent disease-related alterations across the different data types measured by the study. We developed a new method to detect such candidate genes in large multi-omic case-control studies that measure multiple data types in the same set of samples. The method is based on a gene-centric integrative coefficient quantifying to what degree consistent differences are observed in the different data types. For statistical inference, a Bayesian hierarchical model is used to study the distribution of the integrative coefficient. The model employs a conditional autoregressive prior to integrate a functional gene network and to share information between genes known to be functionally related. We applied the method to an AD dataset consisting of histone acetylation, DNA methylation, and RNA transcription data from human cortical tissue samples of 233 subjects, and we detected 816 genes with consistent differences between persons with AD and controls. The findings were validated in protein data and in RNA transcription data from two independent AD studies. Finally, we found three subnetworks of jointly dysregulated genes within the functional gene network which capture three distinct biological processes: myeloid cell differentiation, protein phosphorylation and synaptic signaling. Further investigation of the myeloid network indicated an upregulation of this network in early stages of AD prior to accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau and suggested that increased CSF1 transcription in astrocytes may contribute to microglial activation in AD. Thus, we developed a method that integrates multiple data types and external knowledge of gene function to detect candidate genes, applied the method to an AD dataset, and identified several disease-related genes and processes demonstrating the usefulness of the integrative approach.",2020-04,e1007771,PLoS Comput Biol,PubMed,PMID: 32255787 PMCID: PMC7138305,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32255787,"Humans; Case-Control Studies; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Regulatory Networks; Transcriptome; Alzheimer Disease; Algorithms; Epigenomics; Bayes Theorem; Cell Differentiation",

Preliminary work suggests racial differences in decision making; however, the factors that drive racial differences in decision making remain unclear. We hypothesized literacy, particularly financial and health literacy, mediates racial differences in decision making. DESIGN: Community-based epidemiologic cohort study. SETTING: Communities in northeastern Illinois. PARTICIPANTS: Nondemented Black participants (N = 138) of the Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center Minority Aging Research Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project who completed decision-making and literacy measures were matched to White participants (N = 138) according to age, education, sex, and global cognition using Mahalanobis distance (total N = 276). MEASUREMENTS: All participants completed clinical assessments, a decision-making measure that resembles real-world materials relevant to finance and healthcare, and a financial and health literacy measure. Regression models were used to examine racial differences in decision making and test the hypothesis that literacy mediates this association. In secondary analyses, we examined the impact of literacy in specific domains of decision making (financial and healthcare). RESULTS: In models adjusted for age, education, sex, and global cognition, older Black adults performed lower than older White adults on literacy (β = -8.20; SE = 1.34; 95% CI = -10.82 to -5.57; P < .01) and separately on decision making (β = -.80; SE = .23; 95% CI = -1.25 to -.34; P < .01). However, when decision making was regressed on both race and literacy, the association of race was attenuated and became nonsignificant (β = -.45; SE = .24; 95% CI = -.93 to .02; P = .06), but literacy remained significantly associated with decision making (β = .04; SE = .01; 95% CI = .02-.06; P < .01). In secondary models, a similar pattern was observed for both financial and healthcare decision making. CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in decision making are largely mediated by literacy.

Moreover, lower miR-484 level was associated with higher probability of having Alzheimer's dementia. Importantly, the associations between miR-484 and depressive symptoms and Alzheimer's dementia, respectively, were replicated in an independent cohort. Lastly, the predicted targets of miR-484 were enriched in a brain protein co-expression module involving synaptic transmission and regulation of synaptic plasticity. This study identified four brain microRNAs associated with late-life depressive symptoms assessed longitudinally. In addition, we found a molecular connection between late-life depression and dementia through miR-484.",2020,6,NPJ Genom Med,PubMed,PMID: 32047652 PMCID: PMC7004995,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32047652,Molecular medicine; Depression,

METHODS: We studied the brains of 447 older decedents participating in a clinical-autopsy cohort study. We deployed a wrist worn activity monitor to record total daily physical activity during everyday living in the community-setting. Parkinsonism was assessed with 26 items of a modified motor portion of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). We used linear regression models, controlling for age and sex, to examine the association of physical activity with parkinsonism with and without indices of Alzheimer's disease and related disorders (ADRD) pathologies. In separate models, we added interaction terms to examine if physical activity modified the associations of brain pathologies with parkinsonism. RESULTS: Mean age at death was 90.9 (SD, 6.2), mean severity of parkinsonism was 14.1 (SD, 9.2, Range 0-59.4), and 350 (77%) had evidence of more than one ADRD pathologies. Higher total daily physical activity was associated with less severe parkinsonism (Estimate, -0.315, S.E., 0.052, p<0.001). The association of more physical activity with less severe parkinsonism persisted after adding terms for ten brain pathologies (Estimate, -0.283, S.E., 0.052, p<0.001). The associations of brain pathologies with more severe parkinsonism did not vary with the level of physical activity. CONCLUSION: The association of higher physical activity with less severe parkinsonism may be independent of the presence of ADRD brain pathologies.

We tested whether fragmentation of sustained rest/activity patterns derived from actigraphic recordings at baseline predicts incident heart failure in community-based elderly individuals. METHODS: We studied 1099 community-based elderly adults participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project who had baseline motor activity monitoring up to 11 days and were followed annually for up to 14 years. Fragmentation was assessed using previously validated indexes, derived from the probability of transitions once sustained rest or activity has been established. Heart failure was recorded via a clinical interview during the annual follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models were constructed to examine the relationship between rest fragmentation index and incident heart failure. Covariates grouped in terms of demographics, lifestyle factors and co-morbidities and cardiovascular risk factors/diseases were included. RESULTS: Increased rest fragmentation (but not activity fragmentation) was associated with higher risk for incident heart failure. Specifically, a subject with a rest fragmentation at the 90th percentile showed a 57% increased risk of developing incident heart failure compared to a subject at the 10th percentile in this cohort. This effect was equivalent to that of being over a decade older. These observations were consistent after adjusting for all covariates. CONCLUSION: Increased rest fragmentation, a potential surrogate for sleep fragmentation, is independently associated with a higher risk of developing heart failure in community-based elderly adults during up to 14 years of follow-up. Further work is required to examine the specific contributions from daytime napping versus nighttime sleep periods in the elderly, as well as the underlying autonomic and cardio-dynamic pathways that may explain the effects on heart function.",2020,299-307,Nat Sci Sleep,PubMed,PMID: 32581616 PMCID: PMC7266944,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32581616,sleep fragmentation; mobile health; unobtrusive monitoring; heart failure,

It is particularly important to establish biomarkers of brain aging to better understand neurodegenerative diseases. To advance application of epigenetic clocks-which were largely created with DNA methylation levels in blood samples-for use in brain, we need clearer evaluation of epigenetic clock behavior in brain, including direct comparisons of brain specimens with blood, a more accessible tissue for research. We leveraged data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project to examine three established epigenetic clocks (Horvath, Hannum, PhenoAge clocks) and a newer clock, trained in cortical tissue. We calculated each clock in three different specimens: (1) antemortem CD4+ cells derived from blood (n = 41); (2) postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, n = 730); and (3) postmortem posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, n = 186), among older women and men, age 66-108 years at death. Across all clocks, epigenetic age calculated from blood and brain specimens was generally lower than chronologic age, although differences were smallest for the Cortical clock when calculated in the brain specimens. Nonetheless, we found that Pearson correlations of epigenetic to chronologic ages in brain specimens were generally reasonable for all clocks; correlations for the Horvath, Hannum, and PhenoAge clocks largely ranged from 0.5 to 0.7 (all p < 0.0001). The Cortical clock outperformed the other clocks, reaching a correlation of 0.83 in the DLFPC (p < 0.0001) for epigenetic vs. chronologic age. Nonetheless, epigenetic age was quite modestly correlated across blood and DLPFC in 41 participants with paired samples [Pearson r from 0.21 (p = 0.2) to 0.32 (p = 0.05)], indicating that broader research in neurodegeneration may benefit from clocks using CpG sites better conserved across blood and brain. Finally, in analyses stratified by sex, by pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer disease, and by clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer dementia, correlations of epigenetic to chronologic age remained consistently high across all groups. Future research in brain aging will benefit from epigenetic clocks constructed in brain specimens, including exploration of any advantages of focusing on CpG sites conserved across brain and other tissue types.",2020,555307,Front Neurosci,PubMed,PMID: 33488342 PMCID: PMC7817909,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33488342,aging; dementia; biomarkers; epigenetics; neurology,

Substantial amounts of BDNF are present in peripheral blood, and may serve as biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease incidence as well as targets for intervention to reduce Alzheimer's disease risk. With the exception of the genetic polymorphism in the BDNF gene, Val66Met, which has been extensively studied with regard to neurodegenerative diseases, the genetic variation that influences circulating BDNF levels is unknown. We aimed to explore the genetic determinants of circulating BDNF levels in order to clarify its mechanistic involvement in brain structure and function and Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology in middle-aged and old adults. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association study of circulating BDNF in 11 785 middle- and old-aged individuals of European ancestry from the Age, Gene/Environment Susceptibility-Reykjavik Study (AGES), the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), the Rotterdam Study and the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-Trend). Furthermore, we performed functional annotation analysis and related the genetic polymorphism influencing circulating BDNF to common Alzheimer's disease pathologies from brain autopsies. Mendelian randomization was conducted to examine the possible causal role of circulating BDNF levels with various phenotypes including cognitive function, stroke, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, physical activity and diet patterns. Gene interaction networks analysis was also performed. The estimated heritability of BDNF levels was 30% (standard error = 0.0246, P-value = 4 × 10-48). We identified seven novel independent loci mapped near the BDNF gene and in BRD3, CSRNP1, KDELC2, RUNX1 (two single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and BDNF-AS. The expression of BDNF was associated with neurofibrillary tangles in brain tissues from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project (ROSMAP). Seven additional genes (ACAT1, ATM, NPAT, WDR48, TTC21A, SCN114 and COX7B) were identified through expression and protein quantitative trait loci analyses. Mendelian randomization analyses indicated a potential causal role of BDNF in cardioembolism. Lastly, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis placed circulating BDNF levels in four major networks. Our study provides novel insights into genes and molecular pathways associated with circulating BDNF levels and highlights the possible involvement of plaque instability as an underlying mechanism linking BDNF with brain neurodegeneration.

However, recent research has identified circumstances under which neuroticism is associated with positive outcomes. The current project examined whether ""healthy neuroticism"", defined as the interaction of neuroticism and conscientiousness, was associated with the following health behaviors: smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity. Using a pre-registered multi-study coordinated integrative data analysis (IDA) approach, we investigated whether ""healthy neuroticism"" predicted the odds of engaging in each of the aforementioned activities. Each study estimated identical models, using the same covariates and data transformations, enabling optimal comparability of results. These results were then meta-analyzed in order to estimate an average (N-weighted) effect and to ascertain the extent of heterogeneity in the effects. Overall, these results suggest that neuroticism alone was not related to health behaviors, while individuals higher in conscientiousness were less likely to be smokers or drinkers, and more likely to engage in physical activity. In terms of the healthy neuroticism interaction of neuroticism and conscientiousness, significant interactions for smoking and physical activity suggest that the association between neuroticism and health behaviors was smaller among those high in conscientiousness. These findings lend credence to the idea that healthy neuroticism may be linked to certain health behaviors and that these effects are generalizable across several heterogeneous samples.",2020,32,Collabra Psychol,PubMed,PMID: 33354649 PMCID: PMC7751766,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33354649,Big Five; IALSA; Coordinated IDA; Health Behaviors; Healthy Neuroticism,

A Coordinated Integrative Data Analysis,Collabra.

Although there are robust protective effects for higher levels of conscientiousness, results are mixed for other personality traits. In particular, higher levels of neuroticism have significantly predicted an increased risk of mortality, no-risk at all, and even a reduced risk of dying. The current study hypothesizes that one potential reason for the discrepancy in these findings for neuroticism is that interactions among neuroticism and other key personality traits have largely been ignored. Thus, in the current study we focus on testing whether the personality traits neuroticism and conscientiousness interact to predict mortality. Specifically, we borrow from recent evidence of ""healthy neuroticism"" to explore whether higher levels of neuroticism are only a risk factor for increased mortality risk when conscientiousness levels are low. We conducted a pre-registered integrative data analysis using 12 different cohort studies (total N = 44,702). Although a consistent pattern emerged of higher levels of conscientiousness predicting a reduced hazard of dying, neuroticism did not show a consistent pattern of prediction. Moreover, no study provided statistical evidence of a neuroticism by conscientiousness interaction. The current findings do not support the idea that the combination of high conscientiousness and high neuroticism can be protective for longevity.

In humans, the importance of this effect has remained unclear, partly because reproduction between close relatives is both rare and frequently associated with confounding social factors. Here, using genomic inbreeding coefficients (FROH) for >1.4 million individuals, we show that FROH is significantly associated (p < 0.0005) with apparently deleterious changes in 32 out of 100 traits analysed. These changes are associated with runs of homozygosity (ROH), but not with common variant homozygosity, suggesting that genetic variants associated with inbreeding depression are predominantly rare. The effect on fertility is striking: FROH equivalent to the offspring of first cousins is associated with a 55% decrease [95% CI 44-66%] in the odds of having children.

We tested whether a nonlinear tool of fractal physiology could predict long-term health consequences in a large, elderly cohort. Fractal physiology is an emerging field that aims to study how fractal temporal structures in physiological fluctuations generated by complex physiological networks can provide important information about system adaptability. We assessed fractal temporal correlations in the spontaneous fluctuations of ambulatory motor activity of 1275 older participants at baseline, with a follow-up period of up to 13 years. We found that people with reduced temporal correlations (more random activity fluctuations) at baseline had increased risk of frailty, disability, and all-cause death during follow-up. Specifically, for 1-SD decrease in the temporal activity correlations of this studied cohort, the risk of frailty increased by 31%, the risk of disability increased by 15 to 25%, and the risk of death increased by 26%.

Here, we adopted an integrative multi-omic approach to assess genetic influence on motor impairment in older adults and identified key molecular pathways that may mediate this risk. We built a polygenic risk score for clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (AD-PRS) and examined its relationship to several motor phenotypes in 1885 older individuals from two longitudinal aging cohorts. We found that AD-PRS was associated with a previously validated composite motor scores and their components. The major genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's dementia, the APOE/TOMM40 locus, was not a major driver of these associations. To identify specific molecular features that potentially medicate the genetic risk into motor dysfunction, we examined brain multi-omics, including transcriptome, DNA methylation, histone acetylation (H3K9AC), and targeted proteomics, as well as diverse neuropathologies. We found that a small number of factors account for the majority of the influence of AD-PRS on motor function, which comprises paired helical filament tau-tangle density, H3K9AC in specific chromosomal regions encoding genes involved in neuromuscular process.

Here we show that extended longevity in humans is associated with a distinct transcriptome signature in the cerebral cortex that is characterized by downregulation of genes related to neural excitation and synaptic function. In Caenorhabditis elegans, neural excitation increases with age and inhibition of excitation globally, or in glutamatergic or cholinergic neurons, increases longevity. Furthermore, longevity is dynamically regulated by the excitatory-inhibitory balance of neural circuits. The transcription factor REST is upregulated in humans with extended longevity and represses excitation-related genes. Notably, REST-deficient mice exhibit increased cortical activity and neuronal excitability during ageing. Similarly, loss-of-function mutations in the C. elegans REST orthologue genes spr-3 and spr-4 elevate neural excitation and reduce the lifespan of long-lived daf-2 mutants. In wild-type worms, overexpression of spr-4 suppresses excitation and extends lifespan.

We examined the extent to which common age-related neuropathologies including Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease (AD) contribute to yearly variability in late life cognition. METHODS: Data came from 1321 community-dwelling older adults who were followed annually for up to 23 years, died and underwent brain autopsy. Cognition was assessed via a comprehensive testing battery. Uniform neuropathologic evaluations assessed burdens of Lewy bodies, AD, infarcts, TDP, hippocampal sclerosis, amyloid angiopathy, atherosclerosis, and arteriolosclerosis. Using mixed effects models, yearly variability in cognition, characterized as within-person variability of annual cognitive scores, was regressed on the nine neuropathologic indices. RESULTS: The average age of decedents was 90 years and 69% were female. At autopsy, about two thirds met the pathologic criteria for AD. Neocortical Lewy bodies were present in 13% of the individuals. Other neuropathologic conditions also were common. All neuropathologic indices except for microinfarcts were associated with cognitive decline. Individuals with neocortical Lewy bodies had almost twice the yearly variability in cognition compared to those without. Individuals with AD had about 70% more variability compared to those without. Yearly variability was present among persons with vascular diseases but to a lesser degree than neocortical Lewy bodies and AD.

We assessed sleep fragmentation by actigraphy and related this to cognitive function, to neocortical microglial marker gene expression measured by RNA sequencing, and to the neocortical density of microglia assessed by immunohistochemistry. Greater sleep fragmentation was associated with higher neocortical expression of genes characteristic of aged microglia, and a higher proportion of morphologically activated microglia, independent of chronological age- and dementia-related neuropathologies.

It was later discovered that intracrine and local forms of RAS exist in the brain apart from the endocrine RAS. This brain-specific RAS plays essential roles in brain homeostasis by acting mainly through four angiotensin receptor subtypes; AT1R, AT2R, MasR, and AT4R. These receptors have opposing effects; AT1R promotes vasoconstriction, proliferation, inflammation, and oxidative stress while AT2R and MasR counteract the effects of AT1R. AT4R is critical for dopamine and acetylcholine release and mediates learning and memory consolidation. Consequently, aging-associated dysregulation of the angiotensin receptor subtypes may lead to adverse clinical outcomes such as Alzheimer's disease and frailty via excessive oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, endothelial dysfunction, microglial polarization, and alterations in neurotransmitter secretion. In this article, we review the brain RAS from this standpoint. After discussing the functions of individual brain RAS components and their intracellular and intracranial locations, we focus on the relationships among brain RAS, aging, frailty, and specific neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and vascular cognitive impairment, through oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, and vascular dysfunction.

The predictive validity of the mover-stayer status for incident Alzheimer's disease (AD) was then assessed. RESULTS: We identified a five-class model across the three time-points: Mixed-Domain Impairment, Memory-Specific Impairment, Frontal Impairment, Average, and Superior Cognition. None of the individuals in the Impairment classes reverted to the Average or Superior classes. Conventional MCI classification identified 26.4% and 14.1% at Times 1 and 2 as false-positive cases. ""Movers"" had 87% increased risk of developing dementia compared to those classified as ""Stayers"". CONCLUSION: Our findings support the use of latent variable modelling that incorporates comprehensive neuropsychological assessment to identify and classify cognitive impairment.",2020,1063-1073,J Alzheimers Dis,PubMed,PMID: 31884467 PMCID: PMC7034515,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31884467,"Alzheimer’s disease; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; dementia; Aging; Memory; Neuropsychological Tests; Models, Theoretical; cognitive heterogeneity; cognitive profiles; cognitive status; individual differences; latent transition analysis; neuropsychological  profiles",

METHODS: As part of a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study, 526 older persons (mean age at death = 90.9 years, 71% female) without dementia at baseline completed annual cognitive testing and were autopsied at death. Hospitalization information was obtained from linked Medicare claims records. Neuropathologic examination assessed β-amyloid burden, tau tangle density, neocortical Lewy bodies, hippocampal sclerosis, chronic gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts, and transactive response DNA binding protein 43 kDa. RESULTS: Over a mean of 5.1 years, a total of 1,383 hospitalizations occurred, and the mean annual rate of hospitalization was 0.5 (standard deviation = 0.6, median = 0.4). Higher rate of hospitalization was not directly related to higher burden for any of the neuropathologic markers. Higher rate of hospitalization was associated with more rapid cognitive decline (estimate = -0.042, standard error [SE] = 0.012, p < 0.001), and after controlling for all 7 neuropathologic markers, the association was essentially the same (estimate = -0.040, SE = 0.013, p = 0.002). In a multivariable model with 3-way interactions of neuropathologic markers with hospitalization rate and time, the association between hospitalization rate and faster cognitive decline was greater in persons with more tangle pathology (estimate for interaction = -0.007, SE = 0.002, p = 0.002) and in persons with neocortical Lewy bodies (estimate for interaction = -0.117, SE = 0.042, p = 0.005).

We found that higher serum levels of 3 acylcarnitines, including decanoylcarnitine (C10), pimelylcarnitine (C7-DC), and tetradecadienylcarnitine (C14:2), significantly predict a lower risk of incident AD (composite hazard ratio = 0.368, 95% CI [0.207, 0.653]) after an average of 4.5-year follow-up, independent of age, sex, and education. In addition, baseline serum levels of ten glycerophospholipids, one amino acid, and 5 acylcarnitines predict the longitudinal change in cognitive functions. Moreover, 28 brain metabolites were associated with AD phenotypes.

The HCAP is part of an international research collaboration funded by the National Institute on Aging to better measure and identify cognitive impairment and dementia in representative population-based samples of older adults, in the context of ongoing longitudinal studies of aging in high-, middle-, and low-income countries around the world. METHODS: The HCAP cognitive test battery was designed to measure a range of key cognitive domains affected by cognitive aging (including attention, memory, executive function, language, and visuospatial function) and to allow harmonization and comparisons to other studies in the United States and around the world. The HCAP included a pair of in-person interviews, one with the target HRS respondent (a randomly selected HRS sample member, aged 65+) that lasted approximately 1 h and one with an informant nominated by the respondent that lasted approximately 20 min. The final HRS HCAP sample included 3,496 study subjects, representing a 79% response rate among those invited to participate. CONCLUSION: Linking detailed HCAP cognitive assessments to the wealth of available longitudinal HRS data on cognition, health, biomarkers, genetics, health care utilization, informal care, and economic resources and behavior will provide unique and expanded opportunities to study cognitive impairment and dementia in a nationally representative US population-based sample. The fielding of similar HCAP projects in multiple countries around the world will provide additional opportunities to study international differences in the prevalence, incidence, and outcomes of dementia globally with comparable data.

RESULTS: Of the 280 participants, 101 (36.1%) had LBs which were maximal in the olfactory bulb and tract (85.1%) and least in Heschl's cortex (21.8%). Due to the small number of cases in Braak PD stages 2, 3 and 5, the distribution of LBs in the 6 Braak PD stages was contracted into 3 main LB stages: (1) LBs in olfactory bulbs and dorsal motor nucleus of vagus, (2) further extension of LBs to limbic and other brainstem regions and (3) additional extension of LBs to neocortical areas. MMSE, global cognition and odor test scores were lower and frequency of dementia was higher at the time of the last valid BSIT, in cases with LBs as compared to those without LBs. Linear regression analyses showed that LBs were associated with impaired olfaction. However, on stratification of LBs into 3 stages, only the stage 3 cases were independently associated with impaired olfaction.

Conversely, ongoing depressive symptoms can negatively impact older adults' perceptions of their memory performance. The current study examined the longitudinal associations between self-reported memory problems and depressive symptoms to explore which symptom tends to appear first.Method: Two datasets from ongoing observational, longitudinal studies of aging (Memory and Aging Project; Minority Aging Research Study) were used for secondary analyses. Older adults (n = 1,724; Mage = 77.03; SD = 7.54; 76.80% female; 32.26% Black) completed up to 18 annual assessments of self-reported memory (two items: perceived decline in memory and frequency of memory problems) and depressive symptoms. Multilevel models were used to examine intra-individual variability and time-lagged relationships between self-reported memory and depressive symptoms.Results: Concurrently, self-reported memory problems and depressive symptoms were significantly related; at times when older adults reported poorer memory, they also reported more depressive symptoms, regardless of the type of memory self-report. Prospectively, perceived memory decline predicted future depressive symptoms, but depressive symptoms did not predict future reports of memory decline. Self-reported frequency of memory problems did not predict future depressive symptoms or vice versa.Conclusion: The current study's findings suggest a temporal relationship between perceived memory decline and depressive symptoms, such that perceived memory decline can lead to future depressive symptoms.

We examined if these metrics predict incident parkinsonism. METHODS: Parkinsonism was assessed annually in 683 ambulatory, community-dwelling older adults without parkinsonism at baseline. Four parkinsonian signs were derived from a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Parkinsonism was based on the presence of 2 or more signs.

We examined if combinations of gait speed and other mobility metrics are associated with specific health outcomes. METHODS: A sensor (triaxial accelerometer and gyroscope) placed on the lower back, measured mobility in the homes of 1,249 older adults (77% female; 80.0, SD = 7.72 years). Twelve gait scores were extracted from five performances, including (a) walking, (b) transition from sit to stand, (c) transition from stand to sit, (d) turning, and (e) standing posture. Using separate Cox proportional hazards models, we examined which metrics were associated with time to mortality, incident activities of daily living disability, mobility disability, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease dementia. We used a single integrated analytic framework to determine which gait scores survived to predict each outcome. RESULTS: During 3.6 years of follow-up, 10 of the 12 gait scores predicted one or more of the five health outcomes. In further analyses, different combinations of 2-3 gait scores survived backward elimination and were associated with the five outcomes. Sway was one of the three scores that predicted activities of daily living disability but was not included in the final models for other outcomes. Gait speed was included along with other metrics in the final models predicting mortality and activities of daily living disability but not for other outcomes.

RESULTS: Among 1,505 people with LOAD from the three studies, there were substantial differences across subgroups in total CES-D score, with lower scores (less depression) for people with AD with relative impairments in memory (AD-Memory) compared to those in other groups. Differences were noteworthy for the sleep-related item of the CES-D, as people with AD-Memory were less likely to report restless sleep than people in other groups.

To better understand disease, new multi-omic data-sets have recently been generated with the goal of identifying molecular causes of disease. However, most analytic studies using these datasets focus on uni-modal analysis of the data. Here, we propose a data driven approach to integrate multiple data types and analytic outcomes to aggregate evidences to support the hypothesis that a gene is a genetic driver of the disease. The main algorithmic contributions of our article are: (i) a general machine learning framework to learn the key characteristics of a few known driver genes from multiple feature sets and identifying other potential driver genes which have similar feature representations, and (ii) A flexible ranking scheme with the ability to integrate external validation in the form of Genome Wide Association Study summary statistics. While we currently focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach using different analytic outcomes from RNA-Seq studies, this method is easily generalizable to other data modalities and analysis types. RESULTS: We demonstrate the utility of our machine learning algorithm on two benchmark multiview datasets by significantly outperforming the baseline approaches in predicting missing labels. We then use the algorithm to predict and rank potential drivers of Alzheimer's. We show that our ranked genes show a significant enrichment for single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with Alzheimer's and are enriched in pathways that have been previously associated with the disease.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of lifespan CR with dementia risk, taking brain pathologies into account. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used data from 2022 participants in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing community-based cohort study with annual follow-up from 1997 to 2018 (mean follow-up, 6 years; maximum follow-up, 20 years). After excluding 420 individuals who had prevalent dementia, missing data on CR, or dropped out, 1602 dementia-free adults were identified at baseline and evaluated to detect incident dementia. During follow-up, 611 died and underwent autopsies. Data were analyzed from May to September 2018. EXPOSURES: Information on CR factors (education; early-life, midlife, and late-life cognitive activities; and social activities in late life) was obtained at baseline. Based on these factors, lifespan CR scores were captured using a latent variable from a structural equation model and was divided into tertiles (lowest, middle, and highest). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Dementia was diagnosed following international criteria. Neuropathologic evaluations for Alzheimer disease and other brain pathologies were performed in autopsied participants. The association of lifespan CR with dementia or brain pathologies was estimated using Cox regression models or logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 1602 included participants, 1216 (75.9%) were women, and the mean (SD) age was 79.6 (7.5) years. During follow-up, 386 participants developed dementia (24.1%), including 357 participants with Alzheimer disease-related dementia (22.3%). The multiadjusted hazards ratios (HRs) of dementia were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.59-0.99) for participants in the middle CR score tertile and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.47-0.81) for those in the highest CR score tertile compared with those in the lowest CR score tertile. In autopsied participants, CR was not associated with most brain pathologies, and the association of CR with dementia remained significant after additional adjustment for brain pathologies (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.42-0.86).

However, there are limited studies investigating the behavioral features associated with hyperphosphorylated transactive response DNA-binding protein-43 (TDP-43), a common age-related pathology, and even fewer studies investigating the neurobiological basis underlying low literacy in aging. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that TDP-43 pathology is associated with lower literacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data came from 293 community-based older persons who were enrolled in 2 ongoing studies of aging. Participants completed literacy and cognitive assessments, consented to brain donation, and underwent detailed neuropathologic evaluation for Alzheimer disease (AD) and TDP-43. Linear regression models assessed the association of TDP-43 with literacy after adjusting for demographics, and AD pathology. Posthoc pairwise comparisons examined whether the level of literacy differed by TDP-43 stage. RESULTS: TDP-43 pathology was associated with lower literacy (estimate=-3.16; SE=0.86; P<0.001), above and beyond demographics and AD pathology, and this association persisted even after additionally adjusting for global cognition (estimate=-1.53; SE=0.74; P=0.038).

AIMS: To determine whether lower literacy, as reflected in measures of total literacy and subscales of health and financial literacy, was associated with an increased risk of mortality. METHODS: Participants were 931 community-based older adults from the Rush Memory and Aging Project [age: mean (SD) = 80.9 (7.6), range 58.8-100.8], an ongoing, prospective observational cohort study of aging. Participants were without dementia at the time literacy was assessed. Proportional hazards models were used to determine whether literacy measures were associated with mortality. RESULTS: During up to 8 years of follow-up, 224 (24.1% of 931) participants died. In models that adjusted for age, sex, and education, lower total, health, and financial literacy were each associated with an increased risk of mortality (total literacy: HR = 1.020, 95% CI 1.010-1.031, p < 0.001; health literacy: HR = 1.015, 95% CI 1.008-1.023, p < 0.001; financial literacy: HR = 1.013, 95% CI 1.003-1.023, p = 0.014). These associations persisted after additionally adjusting for income and indices of health status; however, only the association of lower health literacy with mortality persisted after further adjusting for a robust measure of global cognition.

We investigated discrepancies between literacy and cognition and factors associated with such discrepancies in older adults without dementia. METHOD: Participants (N = 714; Mage = 81.4; education: M = 15.4; 75.4% female; 5.2% non-White) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project completed cognitive assessments and a financial and health literacy measure that yielded a total literacy score. Participants were characterized into three groups: (a) total literacy scores that are more than one standard deviation (1 SD) above cognition (L > C), (b) total literacy scores falling more than 1 SD below cognition (L < C), and (c) total literacy within 1 SD of cognition (L = C). Logistic regressions were employed to investigate associations between demographic and psychosocial variables and discrepancy group status. RESULTS: Of the 714 participants, 24% showed significant discrepancies. In fully adjusted models, in reference to the L = C group, male sex was associated with greater odds of being in the L > C group (odds ratio [OR] = 2.32, 95% CI [1.33, 4.03], p = .003) and lower odds of being in the L < C group (OR = 0.31, 95% CI [0.14, 0.66], p = .002), higher income was associated with lower odds of being in either discrepancy group (L < C OR = 0.87, 95% CI [0.79, 0.96], p = .004; L > C OR = 0.86, 95% CI [0.76, 0.96], p = .007), and higher trust was associated with lower odds of being in the L > C group (OR = 0.92, 95% CI [0.85, 0.99], p = .030).

However, evaluating the replicability of associations between aging-related changes in physical and cognitive functioning is challenging due to differences in study designs and analytical models. A multiple-study coordinated analysis approach was used to generate new longitudinal results based on comparable construct-level measurements and identical statistical models and to facilitate replication and research synthesis. METHODS: We performed coordinated analysis on 9 cohort studies affiliated with the Integrative Analysis of Longitudinal Studies of Aging and Dementia (IALSA) research network. Bivariate linear mixed models were used to examine associations among individual differences in baseline level, rate of change, and occasion-specific variation across grip strength and indicators of cognitive function, including mental status, processing speed, attention and working memory, perceptual reasoning, verbal ability, and learning and memory. Results were summarized using meta-analysis. RESULTS: After adjustment for covariates, we found an overall moderate association between change in grip strength and change in each cognitive domain for both males and females: Average correlation coefficient was 0.55 (95% CI = 0.44-0.56). We also found a high level of heterogeneity in this association across studies.

By using the gene expression imputation models fitted from reference datasets that have both genetic and transcriptomic data, TWASs facilitate gene-based tests with GWAS data while accounting for the reference transcriptomic data. The existing TWAS tools like PrediXcan and FUSION use parametric imputation models that have limitations for modeling the complex genetic architecture of transcriptomic data. Therefore, to improve on this, we employ a nonparametric Bayesian method that was originally proposed for genetic prediction of complex traits, which assumes a data-driven nonparametric prior for cis-eQTL effect sizes. The nonparametric Bayesian method is flexible and general because it includes both of the parametric imputation models used by PrediXcan and FUSION as special cases. Our simulation studies showed that the nonparametric Bayesian model improved both imputation R2 for transcriptomic data and the TWAS power over PrediXcan when ≥1% cis-SNPs co-regulate gene expression and gene expression heritability ≤0.2. In real applications, the nonparametric Bayesian method fitted transcriptomic imputation models for 57.8% more genes over PrediXcan, thus improving the power of follow-up TWASs.

We examined if these metrics predict incident parkinsonism. METHODS: Parkinsonism was assessed annually in 683 ambulatory, community-dwelling older adults without parkinsonism at baseline. Four parkinsonian signs were derived from a modified Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Parkinsonism was based on the presence of 2 or more signs. Participants wore a sensor on their back while performing a 32 foot walk, standing posture, and Timed Up and Go (TUG) tasks. 12 mobility scores were extracted. Cox proportional hazards models with backward elimination were used to identify combinations of mobility scores independently associated with incident parkinsonism. RESULTS: During follow-up of 2.5 years (SD = 1.28), 139 individuals developed parkinsonism (20.4%). In separate models, 6 of 12 mobility scores were individually associated with incident parkinsonism, including: Speed and Regularity (from 32 ft walk), Sway (from standing posture), and 3 scores from TUG subtasks (Posterior sit to stand transition, Range stand to sit transition, and Yaw, a measure of turning efficiency).

Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15 as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity, lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting APP and Aβ processing are associated not only with early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with LOAD.

Domain-specific health and financial literacy are particularly relevant to older adults as they face increasingly complex health and financial demands including those related to chronic conditions like type 2 diabetes. We therefore investigated the associations of literacy, including health and financial literacy, with diabetes indicators (ie, haemoglobin A1c and blood glucose) in a community-based cohort study of ageing. METHODS: Participants were 908 non-demented older adults (age ~81 years;75% women) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Literacy was measured using questions designed to assess comprehension of health and financial information and concepts and yielded a total score and domain-specific health and financial literacy scores. Non-fasting haemoglobin A1c and blood glucose samples were collected, participants were queried about diabetes status and medications for diabetes were visually inspected and coded. Participants also underwent a cognitive assessment, medical history and depressive symptom screening. RESULTS: In separate multivariable linear regression models, total (p values <0.03) and health (p values <0.009) literacy were inversely associated with haemoglobin A1c and blood glucose levels after adjusting for age, sex, education, hypertension, global cognitive functioning and depressive symptoms. Financial literacy was inversely associated with haemoglobin A1c levels in adjusted models (p=0.04). Sensitivity analyses conducted among individuals without diabetes revealed similar results.

We previously constructed a probabilistic causal network model of sporadic LOAD and identified TYROBP/DAP12, encoding a microglial transmembrane signaling polypeptide and direct adapter of TREM2, as the most robust key driver gene in the network. Here, we show that absence of TYROBP/DAP12 in a mouse model of AD-type cerebral Aβ amyloidosis (APPKM670/671NL/PSEN1Δexon9) recapitulates the expected network characteristics by normalizing the transcriptome of APP/PSEN1 mice and repressing the induction of genes involved in the switch from homeostatic microglia to disease-associated microglia (DAM), including Trem2, complement (C1qa, C1qb, C1qc, and Itgax), Clec7a and Cst7. Importantly, we show that constitutive absence of TYROBP/DAP12 in the amyloidosis mouse model prevented appearance of the electrophysiological and learning behavior alterations associated with the phenotype of APPKM670/671NL/PSEN1Δexon9 mice. Our results suggest that TYROBP/DAP12 could represent a novel therapeutic target to slow, arrest, or prevent the development of sporadic LOAD.

To determine if protective mechanisms may occur at the transcriptional level, we used microarrays to investigate the relationship between physical activity levels and gene expression patterns in the cognitively intact aged human hippocampus. In parallel, hippocampal gene expression patterns associated with aging and AD were assessed using publicly available microarray data profiling hippocampus from young (20-59 years), cognitively intact aging (73-95 years) and age-matched AD cases. To identify ""anti-aging/AD"" transcription patterns associated with physical activity, probesets significantly associated with both physical activity and aging/AD were identified and their directions of expression change in each condition were compared. Remarkably, of the 2210 probesets significant in both data sets, nearly 95% showed opposite transcription patterns with physical activity compared with aging/AD. The majority (>70%) of these anti-aging/AD genes showed increased expression with physical activity and decreased expression in aging/AD. Enrichment analysis of the anti-aging/AD genes showing increased expression in association with physical activity revealed strong overrepresentation of mitochondrial energy production and synaptic function, along with axonal function and myelin integrity. Synaptic genes were notably enriched for synaptic vesicle priming, release and recycling, glutamate and GABA signaling, and spine plasticity. Anti-aging/AD genes showing decreased expression in association with physical activity were enriched for transcription-related function (notably negative regulation of transcription). These data reveal that physical activity is associated with a more youthful profile in the hippocampus across multiple biological processes, providing a potential molecular foundation for how physical activity can delay age- and AD-related decline of hippocampal function.",2019-06,142-154,Neurobiol Aging,PubMed,PMID: 30927700 PMCID: PMC6901108,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927700,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Humans; Middle Aged; Young Adult; Mitochondria; Gene Expression; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Aging; Hippocampus; Synaptic Vesicles; Exercise; Microarray Analysis; Energy Metabolism; White matter; Neuronal Plasticity; Microarray; Axons; Myelin; Axon; Plasticity; Synaptic vesicle trafficking",

METHODS: Analyses are based on older participants in a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study who had annual cognitive testing (n = 2,899) and subgroups that developed incident dementia (n = 696), died, and underwent a neuropathologic examination from which 10 neurodegenerative and cerebrovascular markers were derived (n = 752), or both (n = 405). Cognitive test scores were converted to a standard scale and averaged to yield composite measures of cognition. RESULTS: Participants had a mean of 16.3 years of education (SD = 3.7, range 0-30). In all participants, education was associated with initial level of global cognition but not rate of cognitive change. In those who developed dementia, rate of global cognitive decline accelerated a mean of 1.8 years before the diagnosis, but education was not related to the onset or rate of accelerated decline. In the deceased, rate of global cognitive decline accelerated a mean of 3.4 years before death, but higher educational attainment was related to earlier (not later) onset of accelerated decline and unrelated to rate of acceleration. Higher education was associated with lower likelihood of gross and microscopic cerebral infarcts but not with other neuropathologic markers.

We previously identified five loci associated with LM adjusted for fat mass in kilograms. Such an adjustment may reduce the power to identify genetic signals having an association with both lean mass and fat mass. OBJECTIVES: To determine the impact of different fat mass adjustments on genetic architecture of LM and identify additional LM loci. METHODS: We performed genome-wide association analyses for whole-body LM (20 cohorts of European ancestry with n = 38,292) measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) or bioelectrical impedance analysis, adjusted for sex, age, age2, and height with or without fat mass adjustments (Model 1 no fat adjustment; Model 2 adjustment for fat mass as a percentage of body mass; Model 3 adjustment for fat mass in kilograms). RESULTS: Seven single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in separate loci, including one novel LM locus (TNRC6B), were successfully replicated in an additional 47,227 individuals from 29 cohorts. Based on the strengths of the associations in Model 1 vs Model 3, we divided the LM loci into those with an effect on both lean mass and fat mass in the same direction and refer to those as ""sumo wrestler"" loci (FTO and MC4R). In contrast, loci with an impact specifically on LM were termed ""body builder"" loci (VCAN and ADAMTSL3). Using existing available genome-wide association study databases, LM increasing alleles of SNPs in sumo wrestler loci were associated with an adverse metabolic profile, whereas LM increasing alleles of SNPs in ""body builder"" loci were associated with metabolic protection. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we identified one novel LM locus (TNRC6B).

Neurology,1474-4465,10.1016/S1474-4422(18)30371-5,"BACKGROUND: Some people with substantial Alzheimer's disease pathology at autopsy had shown few characteristic clinical symptoms or signs of the disease, whereas others with little Alzheimer's disease pathology have been diagnosed with Alzheimer's dementia. We aimed to examine whether frailty, which is associated with both age and dementia, moderates the relationship between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional analysis of data from participants of the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a clinical-pathological cohort study of older adults (older than 59 years) without known dementia at baseline, living in Illinois, USA. Participants in the cohort study underwent annual neuropsychological and clinical evaluations. In the present cross-sectional analysis, we included those participants who did not have any form of dementia or who had Alzheimer's dementia at the time of their last clinical assessment and who had died and for whom complete autopsy data were available. Alzheimer's disease pathology was quantified by a summary measure of neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic and diffuse plaques. Clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia was based on clinician consensus. Frailty was operationalised retrospectively using health variable information obtained at each clincial evaluation using the deficit accumulation approach (41-item frailty index). Logistic regression and moderation modelling were used to assess relationships between Alzheimer's disease pathology, frailty, and Alzheimer's dementia. All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and education. FINDINGS: Up to data cutoff (Jan 20, 2017), we included 456 participants (mean age at death 89·7 years [SD 6·1]; 316 [69%] women). 242 (53%) had a diagnosis of possible or probable Alzheimer's dementia at their last clinical assessment. Frailty (odds ratio 1·76, 95% CI 1·54-2·02; p<0·0001) and Alzheimer's disease pathology (4·81, 3·31-7·01; p<0·0001) were independently associated with Alzheimer's dementia, after adjusting for age, sex, and education. When frailty was added to the model for the relationship between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia, model fit improved (p<0·0001). There was a significant interaction between frailty and Alzheimer's disease pathology (odds ratio 0·73, 95% CI 0·57-0·94; pinteraction=0·015). People with an increased frailty score had a weakened direct link between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia; that is, people with a low amount of frailty were better able to tolerate Alzheimer's disease pathology, whereas those with higher amounts of frailty were more likely both to have more Alzheimer's disease pathology and for it to be expressed as dementia. INTERPRETATION: The degree of frailty among people of the same age modifies the association between Alzheimer's disease pathology and Alzheimer's dementia. That frailty is related to both odds of Alzheimer's dementia and disease expression has implications for clinical management, since individuals with even a low level of Alzheimer's disease pathology might be at risk for dementia if they have high amounts of frailty. Further research should assess how frailty and cognition change over time to better elucidate this complex relationship.

Excluding ε2/ε4 carriers, multivariable regressions for each CVD-related neuropathology compared ε4 and ε2 carriers to ε3/ε3 carriers adjusting for confounders including age and Alzheimer's neuropathology.

We have previously developed and validated a polygenic hazard score comprising of 31 single nucleotide polymorphisms for predicting Alzheimer's disease dementia age of onset. In this study, we examined whether polygenic hazard scores are associated with: (i) regional tracer uptake using amyloid PET; (ii) regional volume loss using longitudinal MRI; (iii) post-mortem regional amyloid-β protein and tau associated neurofibrillary tangles; and (iv) four common non-Alzheimer's pathologies. Even after accounting for APOE, we found a strong association between polygenic hazard scores and amyloid PET standard uptake volume ratio with the largest effects within frontal cortical regions in 980 older individuals across the disease spectrum, and longitudinal MRI volume loss within the entorhinal cortex in 607 older individuals across the disease spectrum. We also found that higher polygenic hazard scores were associated with greater rates of cognitive and clinical decline in 632 non-demented older individuals, even after controlling for APOE status, frontal amyloid PET and entorhinal cortex volume. In addition, the combined model that included polygenic hazard scores, frontal amyloid PET and entorhinal cortex volume resulted in a better fit compared to a model with only imaging markers. Neuropathologically, we found that polygenic hazard scores were associated with regional post-mortem amyloid load and neuronal neurofibrillary tangles, even after accounting for APOE, validating our imaging findings. Lastly, polygenic hazard scores were associated with Lewy body and cerebrovascular pathology.

METHODS: At annual intervals for up to 21 years, 915 older participants in a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study completed a battery of 15 tests from which previously established composite measures of episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed were derived. At death, they underwent a neuropathologic examination to quantify Alzheimer disease pathology, Lewy bodies, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, and hippocampal sclerosis plus multiple markers of cerebrovascular disease. Time-varying effect models were used to assess change over time in the relation of neuropathologic markers to cognitive trajectories. RESULTS: Controlling for pathology, decline in perceptual speed was evident about 15 years before death; modest decline in semantic and working memory occurred later; and there was little change in episodic memory. Each neurodegenerative marker was associated with lower episodic memory function beginning about 10 to 16 years before death. As time before death decreased, Alzheimer disease pathology, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis were associated with impairment in other cognitive domains but the association of TDP-43 pathology with cognition continued to be mainly confined to episodic memory.

METHODS: Data came from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a prospective cohort study of community-dwelling older persons without baseline dementia. Annual measures of cognition via a battery of 19 tests were linked to 1999 to 2010 Medicare claims records. RESULTS: Of 777 participants, 460 (59.2%) were hospitalized over a mean of 5.0 (SD = 2.6) years; 222 (28.6%) had at least one elective and 418 (53.8%) at least one nonelective hospitalization.

However, the gene expression changes underlying microglia activation in response to tau pathology remain elusive. Furthermore, it is not clear how murine gene expression changes relate to human gene expression networks. METHODS: Microglia cells were isolated from rTg4510 tau transgenic mice and gene expression was profiled using RNA sequencing. Four age groups of mice (2-, 4-, 6-, and 8-months) were analyzed to capture longitudinal gene expression changes that correspond to varying levels of pathology, from minimal tau accumulation to massive neuronal loss. Statistical and system biology approaches were used to analyze the genes and pathways that underlie microglia activation. Differentially expressed genes were compared to human brain co-expression networks. RESULTS: Statistical analysis of RNAseq data indicated that more than 4000 genes were differentially expressed in rTg4510 microglia compared to wild type microglia, with the majority of gene expression changes occurring between 2- and 4-months of age. These genes belong to four major clusters based on their temporal expression pattern. Genes involved in innate immunity were continuously up-regulated, whereas genes involved in the glutamatergic synapse were down-regulated. Up-regulated innate inflammatory pathways included NF-κB signaling, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, lysosome, oxidative phosphorylation, and phagosome. NF-κB and cytokine signaling were among the earliest pathways activated, likely driven by the RELA, STAT1 and STAT6 transcription factors. The expression of many AD associated genes such as APOE and TREM2 was also altered in rTg4510 microglia cells. Differentially expressed genes in rTg4510 microglia were enriched in human neurodegenerative disease associated pathways, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's diseases, and highly overlapped with the microglia and endothelial modules of human brain transcriptional co-expression networks.

Scientists have discovered that the causes of AD may include a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors, but the exact cause has not yet been elucidated. Effective strategies to prevent and treat AD therefore remain elusive. The identified genetic causes of AD mainly focus on individual genes, but growing evidence has shown that complex diseases are usually affected by the interaction of genes in a network. Few studies have focused on the interactions and correlations between genes and how they are gradually destroyed or disappear during AD progression. A differential network analysis has been recognized as an essential tool for identifying the underlying pathogenic mechanisms and significant genes for prediction analysis. We therefore aim to conduct a differential network analysis to reveal potential networks involved in the neuropathogenesis of AD and identify genes for AD prediction. Methods: In this paper, we selected 365 samples from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, including 193 clinically and neuropathologically confirmed AD subjects and 172 no cognitive impairment (NCI) controls. Then, we selected 158 genes belonging to the AD pathway (hsa05010) of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. We employed a machine learning method, namely, joint density-based non-parametric differential interaction network analysis and classification (JDINAC), in the analysis of gene expression data (RNA-seq data). We searched for the differential networks in the RNA-seq data with a pathological diagnosis of AD. Finally, an optimal prediction model was built through cross-validation, which showed good discrimination and calibration for AD prediction. Results: We used JDINAC to derive a gene co-expression network and to explore the relationship between the interaction of gene pairs and AD, and the top 10 differential gene pairs were identified. We then compared the prediction performance between JDINAC and individual genes based on prediction methods. JDINAC provides better accuracy of classification than the latest methods, such as random forest and penalized logistic regression.

A prolonged duration of the separation between tasks in the distinct-strategy (D-interval) and a prolonged duration of the overlap interval in overlapping-strategy (O-interval) are related to worse motor symptoms and poorer cognition. In the present study, we evaluated what strategy is employed by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) when they transition from turning to sitting. METHODS: 96 participants with PD performed turn to sit as part of the Timed Up and Go test, both with and without medications, while wearing a body-fixed sensor. We quantified the turn-to-sit transition and determined which strategy (distinct or overlapping) was employed. We then stratified the cases and used regression models adjusted for age, gender, height, and weight to examine the associations of the D-interval or O-interval with parkinsonian features and cognition. RESULTS: Most patients (66%) employed the overlapping-strategy, both off and on anti-parkinsonian medications. Longer O-intervals were associated with longer duration of PD, more severe PD motor symptoms, a higher postural-instability-gait-disturbance (PIGD) score, and worse freezing of gait. Longer D-intervals were not associated with disease duration or PD motor symptoms. Neither the D- nor O-intervals were related to cognitive function. Individuals who employed the overlapping-strategy had more severe postural instability (i.e., higher PIGD scores), as compared to those who used the distinct-strategy. SIGNIFICANCE: In contrast to older adults without PD, most patients with PD utilize the overlapping strategy. Poorer postural and gait control are associated with the strategy choice and with the duration of concurrent performance of turning and sitting. Additional work is needed to further explicate the mechanisms underlying these strategies and their clinical implications.",2019-01,224-229,Gait Posture,PubMed,PMID: 30380506 PMCID: PMC6287952,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30380506,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Cognition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Parkinson Disease; Gait Disorders, Neurologic; Postural Balance; Accelerometry; Cognitive function; Wearable Electronic Devices; Accelerometer; Body-fixed sensor; Diagnostic Techniques, Neurological; Parkinson's disease; Sitting Position; Time and Motion Studies; Wearables",

Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing can improve the understanding of the causes of LOAD and provide initial steps required to identify potential therapeutic targets. OBJECTIVE: To identify the genetic loci for LOAD across different ethnic groups. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter cohort study was designed to analyze whole-exome sequencing data from a multiethnic cohort using a transethnic gene-kernel association test meta-analysis, adjusted for sex, age, and principal components, to identify genetic variants associated with LOAD. A meta-analysis was conducted on the results of 2 independent studies of whole-exome and whole-genome sequence data from individuals of European ancestry. This group of European American, African American, and Caribbean Hispanic individuals participating in an urban population-based study were the discovery cohort; the additional cohorts included affected individuals and control participants from 2 publicly available data sets. Replication was achieved using independent data sets from Caribbean Hispanic families with multiple family members affected by LOAD and the International Genetics of Alzheimer Project. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Late-onset Alzheimer disease. RESULTS: The discovery cohort included 3595 affected individuals, while the additional cohorts included 5931 individuals with LOAD and 5504 control participants. Of 3916 individuals in the discovery cohort, we included 3595 individuals (1397 with LOAD and 2198 cognitively healthy controls; 2451 [68.2%] women; mean [SD] age, 80.3 [6.83] years). Another 321 individuals (8.2%) were excluded because of non-LOAD diagnosis, age younger than 60 years, missing covariates, duplicate data, or genetic outlier status. Gene-based tests that compared affected individuals (n = 7328) and control participants (n = 7702) and included only rare and uncommon variants annotated as having moderate-high functional effect supported PINX1 (8p23.1) as a locus with gene-wide significance (P = 2.81 × 10-6) after meta-analysis across the 3 studies.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This analysis combines data from 2 community-based clinicopathologic cohort studies of aging. The Religious Orders Study started in 1994, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project started in 1997. Both studies are ongoing. Participants without known dementia were enrolled and agreed to annual clinical evaluations and brain donation after death. Primary analyses focused on individuals without β-amyloid deposits. Data analyses occurred in mid-September 2018. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: β-Amyloid protein abundance was measured by targeted proteomics using selected reaction monitoring. β-Amyloid deposits were detected using immunohistochemistry. Other neuropathologic indices were quantified via uniform structured evaluation. Linear mixed models were used to examine the association of β-amyloid protein with cognitive decline. Regression models examined the protein associations with neuropathologic outcomes and the APOE genotype. RESULTS: By mid-September 2018, 3575 older persons were enrolled, and 1559 had died and undergone brain autopsy. Proteomic data were collected in 1208 individuals, and 5 with missing cognitive scores were excluded. Of the remaining 1203, primary analyses focused on 148 individuals (12.3%) without β-amyloid deposits. In this group, the mean (SD) age at death was 87.0 (7.0) years, and 84 individuals (56.8%) were women. In the absence of β-amyloid deposits, we did not observe an association of β-amyloid protein with decline in episodic memory, but the protein was associated with faster rates of decline in processing speed (mean [SE] change, -0.014 [0.005]; P = .008) and visuospatial abilities (mean [SE] change, -0.013 [0.005]; P = .006). We did not observe protein association with paired helical filament tau tangle density. The protein was associated with amyloid angiopathy (odds ratio, 1.38 [95% CI, 1.15-1.67]; P < .001) but no other brain pathology. The associations with cognitive decline were unchanged after controlling for amyloid angiopathy. Neither APOE ε4 nor a polygenic Alzheimer risk score was associated with β-amyloid protein. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cortical β-amyloid protein was associated with faster cognitive decline in the absence of β-amyloid deposits, which supports the role of cortical soluble β-amyloid as a neurotoxic agent in aging.

We used a series of mixed-effects models controlling for age and sex to investigate the association of PD pathology (nigral neuronal loss and Lewy bodies) and indices of 8 other brain pathologies with the progression of parkinsonism prior to death. RESULTS: During an average of 8.5 years' follow-up, more than half (771/1,430, 53.9%) developed parkinsonism proximate to death.

Participants completed comprehensive neuroimaging (including DTI, T1- and T2-weighted imaging), a self-report measure of scam susceptibility, and neuropsychological testing. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) investigated associations of DTI-derived measures of fractional anisotropy (FA), trace of the diffusion tensor, axial and radial diffusivity (separately) with scam susceptibility adjusting for age, sex, education, and white matter hyperintensities (WMH; total volume and voxelwise separately). Statistical significance was determined at p < 0.05, Family Wise Error corrected. TBSS revealed significant negative associations between FA in tracts connecting a number of right hemisphere white matter regions and scam susceptibility, particularly after additional adjustment for global cognitive functioning. The pathways implicated were mainly in right temporal-parietal and temporal-occipital regions. Association of trace, axial, and radial diffusivity with scam susceptibility were not significant in fully-adjusted models. Lower white matter integrity within right hemisphere tracts was associated with higher scam susceptibility independent of relevant confounds including global cognition.

IGFBP-5 moderated the association of depressive symptoms with decline in global cognition (p = 0.045). IGFBP-5 mediated ten percent or less of the total effect of depressive symptoms on decline in global cognition and the cognitive domains (p > 0.070). LIMITATIONS: Participants were volunteers and self-selection bias limits the generalizability of our findings. In addition, we used self-reported data on depressive symptoms. However, we also used data on depression medications as sensitivity analyses to confirm findings. CONCLUSIONS: In old age, brain IGFBP-5 is associated with depressive symptoms and cognition.

Specifically, we hypothesized that poorer decision making would be associated with an increased risk of incident Alzheimer's dementia, an increased risk of incident mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a more rapid decline in cognition. DESIGN: An ongoing prospective observational cohort study of aging (the Rush Memory and Aging Project). SETTING: The greater Chicago area. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 952 community-based older adults without dementia at baseline. MEASUREMENTS: Participants completed a measure of healthcare and financial decision making at baseline and underwent annual standardized evaluations to track clinical status and cognitive functions (global cognition, episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability). RESULTS: During up to 9 years of follow-up (M = 5.2 y; standard deviation = 2.7), 156 participants developed Alzheimer's dementia (16.4% of 952), 253 participants developed MCI (33.2% of 760), and each cognitive measure declined (all Ps < .001). In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and education, poorer decision making was associated with an increased risk of incident Alzheimer's dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.17; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.10-1.24; P < .001) and incident MCI (HR = 1.16; 95% CI = 1.10-1.22; P < .001). Further, in linear mixed-effects models, poorer decision making among those who were initially free of cognitive impairment was associated with a more rapid decline in global cognition and four of five specific cognitive domains (all Ps < .05). CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that poorer healthcare and financial decision making heralds adverse cognitive outcomes in old age.

A prolonged duration of the separation between tasks in the distinct-strategy (D-interval) and a prolonged duration of the overlap interval in overlapping-strategy (O-interval) are related to worse motor symptoms and poorer cognition. In the present study, we evaluated what strategy is employed by patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) when they transition from turning to sitting. METHODS: 96 participants with PD performed turn to sit as part of the Timed Up and Go test, both with and without medications, while wearing a body-fixed sensor. We quantified the turn-to-sit transition and determined which strategy (distinct or overlapping) was employed. We then stratified the cases and used regression models adjusted for age, gender, height, and weight to examine the associations of the D-interval or O-interval with parkinsonian features and cognition. RESULTS: Most patients (66%) employed the overlapping-strategy, both off and on anti-parkinsonian medications. Longer O-intervals were associated with longer duration of PD, more severe PD motor symptoms, a higher postural-instability-gait-disturbance (PIGD) score, and worse freezing of gait. Longer D-intervals were not associated with disease duration or PD motor symptoms. Neither the D- nor O-intervals were related to cognitive function. Individuals who employed the overlapping-strategy had more severe postural instability (i.e., higher PIGD scores), as compared to those who used the distinct-strategy. SIGNIFICANCE: In contrast to older adults without PD, most patients with PD utilize the overlapping strategy. Poorer postural and gait control are associated with the strategy choice and with the duration of concurrent performance of turning and sitting.

METHODS: As part of the Alzheimer Disease Sequencing Project, WGS data were generated for 197 NHW participants from 42 families (affected individuals and unaffected, elderly relatives). A two-pronged approach was taken. First, variants were prioritized using heterogeneity logarithm of the odds (HLOD) and family-specific LOD scores as well as annotations based on function, frequency, and segregation with disease. Second, known Alzheimer disease (AD) candidate genes were assessed for rare variation using a family-based association test. RESULTS: We identified 41 rare, predicted-damaging variants that segregated with disease in the families that contributed to the HLOD or family-specific LOD regions. These included a variant in nitric oxide synthase 1 adaptor protein that segregates with disease in a family with 7 individuals with AD, as well as variants in RP11-433J8, ABCA1, and FISP2. Rare-variant association identified 2 LOAD candidate genes associated with disease in these families: FERMT2 (p-values = 0.001) and SLC24A4 (p-value = 0.009). These genes still showed association while controlling for common index variants, indicating the rare-variant signal is distinct from common variation that initially identified the genes as candidates.

The risk conferred by ε4, however, differs across populations, with populations of African ancestry showing lower ε4 risk compared to those of European or Asian ancestry. The cause of this heterogeneity in risk effect is currently unknown; it may be due to environmental or cultural factors correlated with ancestry, or it may be due to genetic variation local to the ApoE region that differs among populations. Exploring these hypotheses may lead to novel, population-specific therapeutics and risk predictions. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed ApoE genotypes and genome-wide array data in individuals from African American and Puerto Rican populations. A total of 1,766 African American and 220 Puerto Rican individuals with late-onset Alzheimer disease, and 3,730 African American and 169 Puerto Rican cognitively healthy individuals (> 65 years) participated in the study. We first assessed average ancestry across the genome (""global"" ancestry) and then tested it for interaction with ApoE genotypes. Next, we assessed the ancestral background of ApoE alleles (""local"" ancestry) and tested if ancestry local to ApoE influenced Alzheimer disease risk while controlling for global ancestry. Measures of global ancestry showed no interaction with ApoE risk (Puerto Rican: p-value = 0.49; African American: p-value = 0.65). Conversely, ancestry local to the ApoE region showed an interaction with the ApoE ε4 allele in both populations (Puerto Rican: p-value = 0.019; African American: p-value = 0.005).

These subgroups differed in demographics, genetic profile, and prognosis. Herein, we assess the generalizability of these findings to an independent sample, the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), which used an overlapping, but distinct neuropsychological battery. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to identify the association of natural subgroups based on neuropsychological performance in the MAP cohort with incident dementia and compare them with the associations identified in the EAS. METHODS: MAP is a community-dwelling cohort of older adults living in the northeastern Illinois, Chicago. Latent class models were applied to baseline scores of 10 neuropsychological measures across 1,662 dementia-free MAP participants. Results were compared to prior findings from the EAS. RESULTS: LCA resulted in a 5-class model: Mixed-Domain Impairment (n = 71, 4.3%), Memory-specific-Impairment (n = 274, 16.5%), Average (n = 767, 46.1%), Frontal Impairment (n = 222, 13.4%), and a class of Superior Cognition (n = 328, 19.7%). Similar to the EAS, the Mixed-Domain Impairment, the Memory-Specific Impairment, and the Frontal Impairment classes had higher risk of incident Alzheimer's disease when compared to the Average class. By contrast, the Superior Cognition had a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease when compared to the Average class. CONCLUSIONS: Natural cognitive subgroups in MAP are similar to those identified in EAS.

We examined the risk of Alzheimer's dementia attributable to pathologic AD and 8 other neuropathologies. METHODS: Participants (n = 1,161) came from 2 clinical-pathological studies of aging. Multivariable logistic regression models examined associations of 8 neuropathological indices with Alzheimer's dementia and quantified the percentage of cases attributable to each. Furthermore, because some dementia cases are not driven by common neuropathologies, we re-estimated the attributable risks after empirically adjusting for such cases. RESULTS: Of 1,161 persons, 512 (44.1%) had Alzheimer's dementia at time of death. With the exception of microinfarcts, all neuropathological indices were independently associated with greater odds of Alzheimer's dementia. Two hundred ten (41.0%) Alzheimer's dementia cases were attributable to pathological AD. Separately, 8.9% were attributable to macroscopic infarcts, 10.8% to Lewy bodies, 5.2% to hippocampal sclerosis, 11.7% to transactive response DNA-binding protein 43, 8.1% to cerebral amyloid angiopathy, 6.0% to atherosclerosis, and 5.2% to arteriolosclerosis. A total of 83.3% of cases were attributable to all 8 indices combined. However, after further adjustment for cases driven by other factors, a total of 67.5% of cases were attributable to all 8 neuropathologic indices combined. INTERPRETATION: Pathological AD accounts for a considerable percentage of Alzheimer's dementia cases, but multiple other neuropathologies also contribute.

Here, we evaluated the utility of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons and astrocytes as tools to systematically test AD-relevant cellular phenotypes following perturbation of candidate genes identified by genome-wide studies. Lentiviral-mediated delivery of shRNAs was used to modulate expression of 66 genes in astrocytes and 52 genes in induced neurons. Five genes (CNN2, GBA, GSTP1, MINT2 and FERMT2) in neurons and nine genes (CNN2, ITGB1, MINT2, SORL1, VLDLR, NPC1, NPC2, PSAP and SCARB2) in astrocytes significantly altered extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) levels. Knockdown of AP3M2, CNN2, GSTP1, NPC1, NPC2, PSAP and SORL1 reduced interleukin-6 levels in astrocytes. Only knockdown of FERMT2 led to a reduction in the proportion of TAU that is phosphorylated. Further, CRISPR-Cas9 targeting of FERMT2 in both familial AD (fAD) and fAD-corrected human neurons validated the findings of reduced extracellular Aβ. Interestingly, FERMT2 reduction had no effect on the Aβ42:40 ratio in corrected neurons and a reduction of phospho-tau, but resulted in an elevation in Aβ42:40 ratio and no reduction in phospho-tau in fAD neurons. Taken together, this study has prioritized 15 genes as being involved in contributing to Aβ accumulation, phosphorylation of tau and/or cytokine secretion, and, as illustrated with FERMT2, it sets the stage for further cell-type-specific dissection of the role of these genes in AD.",01/03/2019,718-735,Hum Mol Genet,PubMed,PMID: 30371777 PMCID: PMC6381320,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30371777,Humans; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Biomarkers; Cell Line; Membrane Proteins; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Brain; tau Proteins; Astrocytes; Neurons; Neoplasm Proteins; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Proteostasis; Gene Targeting,

In fold enrichment plots, we observed robust genetic enrichment in AD as a function of plasma lipids (TG, TC, LDL, and HDL); we found minimal AD genetic enrichment conditional on BMI, T2D, CAD, and WHR. Beyond APOE, at conjunction FDR < 0.05 we identified 90 SNPs on 19 different chromosomes that were jointly associated with AD and CV-associated outcomes.

Multiple linear regression models were constructed to correlate the shape with pathology measures while accounting for covariates, with relationships mapped out onto hippocampal surface locations. A significant relationship existed between higher paired helical filaments-tau burden and inward hippocampal shape deformity in zones approximating CA1 and subiculum which persisted after accounting for coexisting pathologies. No significant patterns of inward surface deformity were associated with amyloid-beta or transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDA after including covariates. Our findings indicate that hippocampal shape deformity measures in surface zones approximating CA1 may represent a biomarker for postmortem AD pathology.",2019-02,171-181,Neurobiol Aging,PubMed,PMID: 30453234 PMCID: PMC6331233,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30453234,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Biomarkers; DNA-Binding Proteins; Alzheimer Disease; tau Proteins; Hippocampus; Neuroimaging; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Diagnosis; TDP-43; Biomarker",

We leveraged postmortem data from 1453 persons who participated in one of two longitudinal community-based studies of older adults, the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Postmortem examination identified AD pathologies, neocortical Lewy bodies, DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), hippocampal sclerosis, gross and micro infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolosclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Linear and logistic regressions examined the association of sex with each of the pathologic measures. Two-thirds of subjects were women (n = 971; 67%), with a mean age at death of 89.8 (SD = 6.6) years in women and 87.3 (SD = 6.6) in men. Adjusted for age and education, women had higher levels on a global measure of AD pathology (estimate = 0.102, SE = 0.022, p < 0.001), and tau tangle density in particular (estimate = 0.334, SE = 0.074, p < 0.001), and there was a borderline difference between women and men in amyloid-β load (estimate = 0.124, SE = 0.065, p = 0.056). In addition, compared to men, women were more likely to have more severe arteriolosclerosis (OR = 1.28, 95% CI:1.04-1.58, p = 0.018), and less likely to have gross infarcts (OR = 0.78, 95% CI:0.61-0.98, p = 0.037), although the association with gross infarct was attenuated after controlling for vascular risk factors.

Bile acids (BAs), products of cholesterol metabolism and clearance, are produced in the liver and are further metabolized by gut bacteria. They have major regulatory and signaling functions and seem dysregulated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Serum levels of 15 primary and secondary BAs and their conjugated forms were measured in 1464 subjects including 370 cognitively normal older adults, 284 with early mild cognitive impairment, 505 with late mild cognitive impairment, and 305 AD cases enrolled in the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assessed associations of BA profiles including selected ratios with diagnosis, cognition, and AD-related genetic variants, adjusting for confounders and multiple testing. RESULTS: In AD compared to cognitively normal older adults, we observed significantly lower serum concentrations of a primary BA (cholic acid [CA]) and increased levels of the bacterially produced, secondary BA, deoxycholic acid, and its glycine and taurine conjugated forms. An increased ratio of deoxycholic acid:CA, which reflects 7α-dehydroxylation of CA by gut bacteria, strongly associated with cognitive decline, a finding replicated in serum and brain samples in the Rush Religious Orders and Memory and Aging Project. Several genetic variants in immune response-related genes implicated in AD showed associations with BA profiles. DISCUSSION: We report for the first time an association between altered BA profile, genetic variants implicated in AD, and cognitive changes in disease using a large multicenter study.

Diet may be a potentially important public health strategy for disability prevention in aging. We examined the relations of the Mediterranean, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), and Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diets to functional disability in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. METHODS: A total of 809 participants (mean age = 80.7 ± 7.2 years, 74% female) without functional disability at baseline were followed for an average of 5.3 years. Standardized measures for self-reported disability including, activities of daily living ADL), instrumental ADL, and mobility disability were assessed annually. The diet scores were computed based on a validated food frequency questionnaire administered at baseline. RESULTS: In Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, education, smoking, physical activity, and total calories, the second (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.60-0.95) and third tertiles (hazard ratio = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.53-0.86) of MIND diet scores had lower rates of ADL disability compared to the lowest tertile (p for trend = .001), whereas only the third tertiles of the Mediterranean (hazard ratio = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.57-0.94) and DASH (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.59-0.95) diets were significantly associated with ADL disability.

Neurology,1474-4465,10.1016/S1474-4422(18)30251-5,"BACKGROUND: Transactive response DNA-binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) proteinopathy in older adults frequently coexists with Alzheimer's disease pathology and hippocampal sclerosis. It is unclear whether there is a link between APOE ε4 and TDP-43 proteinopathy, and the role of APOE ε4 in the association of TDP-43 proteinopathy with hippocampal sclerosis remains to be examined. We investigated the relationships of TDP-43 proteinopathy and hippocampal sclerosis with APOE ε4. METHODS: We used data from two community-based cohort studies of ageing and dementia: the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP). A battery of cognitive tests examining multiple cognitive domains is given to ROS-MAP participants each year, and a measure of annual global cognitive function for each participant is derived by averaging Z scores of these tests. The final clinical diagnosis is assigned after death by a neurologist using all available clinical data without access to post-mortem pathology. Amyloid-β, paired helical filament tau, Lewy bodies, TDP-43, and hippocampal sclerosis were microscopically evaluated in the midbrain, medial temporal, and neocortical regions that capture the progression of each neuropathology. TDP-43 proteinopathy topographic stage was recorded as an ordinal variable, and TDP-43 burden was defined by averaging a semi-quantitative six-point scale across six brain regions. The relationships among APOE ε4, TDP-43 proteinopathy, and hippocampal sclerosis were tested with regression models controlled for sex and age at death, and they were further explored with a mediation analysis using the quasi-Bayesian Monte Carlo method. FINDINGS: ROS began data collection in 1994, and MAP began data collection in 1997. The data included in this study were analysed from Jan 16, 2017, to July 12, 2017. When analysis began in January, 2017, a total of 1059 ROS-MAP participants who were deceased had APOE genotype and complete pathological measures for amyloid-β, paired helical filament tau, and TDP-43 proteinopathy stage. After excluding 15 participants with other pathological diagnoses, 1044 participants, 1042 of whom also had measures of Lewy body pathology, were included in this study (470 from ROS and 574 from MAP). APOE ε4 count was associated with higher TDP-43 proteinopathy stage (odds ratio [OR] 2·0, 95% CI 1·6-2·6; p=1·9 × 10-9) and TDP-43 burden (0·40, 0·28-0·52; p=1·2 × 10-10). Amyloid-β, paired helical filament tau, or Lewy body pathology did not fully explain this association. APOE ε4 increased the odds of hippocampal sclerosis (OR 2·1, 95% CI 1·4-3·0; p=1·7 × 10-4); this effect was largely mediated by TDP-43 burden (mediated effect p<1·0 × 10-4) but not directly by APOE ε4 (direct effect p=0·40). APOE ε4 was associated with worse global cognition proximate to death even after adjusting for amyloid-β and paired helical filament tau (estimated effect -0·18, 95% CI -0·31 to -0·04; p=0·010), but this association was attenuated by additionally adjusting for TDP-43 burden (-0·09, -0·22 to 0·04; p=0·18). INTERPRETATION: APOE ε4 seems to increase TDP-43 burden, and this effect in turn was associated with higher odds of hippocampal sclerosis, a pathology potentially downstream of TDP-43 proteinopathy. TDP-43 proteinopathy contributes to the detrimental effect of APOE ε4 on late-life cognition through mechanisms independent of Alzheimer's disease pathology, and future research should consider that TDP-43 proteinopathy might be an integral component of APOE-related neurodegeneration.

We aimed to measure these effects. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We analyzed data from 3,353 participants from 3 observational community-based cohort studies of older persons (the Rush Memory and Aging Project [MAP], the Religious Orders Study [ROS], and the Minority Aging Research Study [MARS]) and 2 observational memory-clinic-based cohort studies (Centre de Neurologie Cognitive [CNC] study at Lariboisière Hospital and the Sunnybrook Dementia Study [SDS]). We performed neuropsychological testing and, in subsets of participants, evaluated cerebrospinal fluid AD biomarkers, standardized structured autopsy measures, and/or prefrontal cortex gene expression by RNA sequencing. We examined the association between season and these variables using nested multiple linear and logistic regression models. There was a robust association between season and cognition that was replicated in multiple cohorts (amplitude = 0.14 SD [a measure of the magnitude of seasonal variation relative to overall variability; 95% CI 0.07-0.23], p = 0.007, in the combined MAP, ROS, and MARS cohorts; amplitude = 0.50 SD [95% CI 0.07-0.66], p = 0.017, in the SDS cohort). Average composite global cognitive function was higher in the summer and fall compared to winter and spring, with the difference equivalent in cognitive effect to 4.8 years' difference in age (95% CI 2.1-8.4, p = 0.002). Further, the odds of meeting criteria for mild cognitive impairment or dementia were higher in the winter and spring (odds ratio 1.31 [95% CI 1.10-1.57], p = 0.003). These results were robust against multiple potential confounders including depressive symptoms, sleep, physical activity, and thyroid status and persisted in cases with AD pathology. Moreover, season had a marked effect on cerebrospinal fluid Aβ 42 level (amplitude 0.30 SD [95% CI 0.10-0.64], p = 0.003), which peaked in the summer, and on the brain expression of 4 cognition-associated modules of co-expressed genes (m6: amplitude = 0.44 SD [95% CI 0.21-0.65], p = 0.0021; m13: amplitude = 0.46 SD [95% CI 0.27-0.76], p = 0.0009; m109: amplitude = 0.43 SD [95% CI 0.24-0.67], p = 0.0021; and m122: amplitude 0.46 SD [95% CI 0.20-0.71], p = 0.0012), which were in phase or anti-phase to the rhythms of cognition and which were in turn associated with binding sites for several seasonally rhythmic transcription factors including BCL11A, CTCF, EGR1, MEF2C, and THAP1. Limitations include the evaluation of each participant or sample once per annual cycle, reliance on self-report for measurement of environmental and behavioral factors, and potentially limited generalizability to individuals in equatorial regions or in the southern hemisphere. CONCLUSIONS: Season has a clinically significant association with cognition and its neurobiological correlates in older adults with and without AD pathology. There may be value in increasing dementia-related clinical resources in the winter and early spring, when symptoms are likely to be most pronounced. Moreover, the persistence of robust seasonal plasticity in cognition and its neurobiological correlates, even in the context of concomitant AD pathology, suggests that targeting environmental or behavioral drivers of seasonal cognitive plasticity, or the key transcription factors and genes identified in this study as potentially mediating these effects, may allow us to substantially improve cognition in adults with and without AD.",2018-09,e1002647,PLoS Med,PubMed,PMID: 30180184 PMCID: PMC6122787,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30180184,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Gene Expression; Biomarkers; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; Logistic Models; Prefrontal Cortex; Linear Models; Seasons",

Previously we examined how DNA alleles control downstream expression of RNA transcripts and how those relationships are changed in late-onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. We have now examined how proteins are incorporated into networks in two separate series and evaluated our outputs in two different cell lines. Our pipeline included the following steps: (i) predicting expression quantitative trait loci; (ii) determining differential expression; (iii) analysing networks of transcript and peptide relationships; and (iv) validating effects in two separate cell lines. We performed all our analysis in two separate brain series to validate effects. Our two series included 345 samples in the first set (177 controls, 168 cases; age range 65&ndash;105; 58&percnt; female; KRONOSII cohort) and 409 samples in the replicate set (153 controls, 141 cases, 115 mild cognitive impairment; age range 66&ndash;107; 63&percnt; female; RUSH cohort).

HSPA2 was validated in two cell lines, with overexpression driving further elevation of amyloid-&beta;40 and amyloid-&beta;42 levels in APP mutant cells, as well as significant elevation of microtubule associated protein tau and phosphorylated-tau in a modified neuroglioma line.

An age-, sex- and APOE based risk score and family history were used to select cases most likely to harbor novel AD risk variants and controls least likely to develop AD by age 85 years. We tested ~1.5 million single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and 50,000 insertion-deletion polymorphisms (indels) for association to AD, using multiple models considering individual variants as well as gene-based tests aggregating rare, predicted functional, and loss of function variants. Sixteen single variants and 19 genes that met criteria for significant or suggestive associations after multiple-testing correction were evaluated for replication in four independent samples; three with whole exome sequencing (2,778 cases, 7,262 controls) and one with genome-wide genotyping imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium panel (9,343 cases, 11,527 controls). The top findings in the discovery sample were also followed-up in the ADSP whole-genome sequenced family-based dataset (197 members of 42 EA families and 501 members of 157 CH families). We identified novel and predicted functional genetic variants in genes previously associated with AD. We also detected associations in three novel genes: IGHG3 (p = 9.8 × 10-7), an immunoglobulin gene whose antibodies interact with β-amyloid, a long non-coding RNA AC099552.4 (p = 1.2 × 10-7), and a zinc-finger protein ZNF655 (gene-based p = 5.0 × 10-6).

METHODS: This clinical-pathologic study was derived from prospective, community-based cohort studies of aging with similar design and data collection. Measurements of systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were obtained annually (mean follow-up 8 years, SD = 4.8). Postmortem neuropathologic evaluations documented diseases of aging. Using regression analyses, we examined associations of average and decline in late-life SBP, and separately in DBP, with neuropathology. RESULTS: In 1,288 persons (mean age at death = 88.6 years; 65% women), the mean standardized person-specific SBP across the study was 134 (SD = 13) and DBP was 71 (SD = 8) mm Hg. The odds of brain infarcts were increased for participants with a higher mean SBP. Specifically, a person with a 1 SD SBP above the mean (147 vs 134 mm Hg) would have a 46% increased odds of having one or more infarcts, and an increased odds of gross infarct (46%) and microinfarct (36%). Furthermore, a more rapidly declining SBP slope over time increased the odds of one or more infarcts. Mean DBP, not slope, was related to brain infarcts. AD pathology analyses showed an association of a higher mean SBP with higher number of tangles (p = 0.038) but not plaques or other pathology (all p > 0.06). Changes in BP were not significantly related to AD pathology. CONCLUSIONS: Higher average late-life SBP and DBP, and independently a faster decline in SBP, are associated with increasing number of brain infarcts, including gross and microinfarcts. We found some evidence for a relation of SBP with AD, specifically tangles.

The maintenance of energy metabolism, through the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) apparatus, is essential for brain health. Given the known association between reproductive period (years from menarche to menopause) and cognitive aging, we examined the hypothesis that cumulative estrogen exposure across the lifetime may be associated with differential methylation of genes in the OXPHOS pathway. METHODS: Using DNA methylation patterns in the post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 426 women prospectively followed until death in the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project, we examined the relationship between reproductive period (subtracting age at menarche from age at menopause) and DNA methylation of a published set of autosomal OXPHOS genes previously implicated in stroke susceptibility. We then performed an unsupervised analysis of methylation levels across the Hallmark pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database. RESULTS: We observed a strong association between reproductive period and DNA methylation status across OXPHOS CpGs. We replicated this association between reproductive period and DNA methylation in a much larger set of OXPHOS genes in our unsupervised analysis. Here, reproductive period also showed associations with methylation in genes related to E2F, MYC and MTORC1 signaling, fatty acid metabolism and DNA repair.

However, we do not know whether risk for inflammatory disease predisposes unaffected individuals to late-life cognitive deficits or AD-related neuropathology. We investigated whether genetic risk scores for seven immune diseases and central nervous system traits were related to cognitive decline (nmax = 1601), classical AD neuropathology (nmax = 985), or microglial density (nmax = 184). METHODS: Longitudinal cognitive decline, postmortem amyloid and tau neuropathology, microglial density, and gene module expression from bulk brain tissue were all measured in participants from two large cohorts (the Rush Religious Orders Study and Memory and Aging Project; ROS/MAP) of elderly subjects (mean age at entry 78 +/- 8.7 years). We analyzed data primarily using robust regression methods. Neuropathologists were blind to clinical data. RESULTS: The AD genetic risk scores, including and excluding APOE effects, were strongly associated with cognitive decline in all domains (min Puncor = 3.2 × 10- 29). Multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia risk did not influence cognitive decline in older age, but the rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk score alone was significantly associated with microglial density after correction (t146 = - 3.88, Puncor = 1.6 × 10- 4). Post-hoc tests found significant effects of the RA genetic risk score in multiple regions and stages of microglial activation (min Puncor = 1.5 × 10- 6). However, these associations were driven by only one or two variants, rather than cumulative polygenicity. Further, individual MS (Pone-sided < 8.4 × 10- 4) and RA (Pone-sided = 3 × 10- 4) variants associated with higher microglial density were also associated with increased expression of brain immune gene modules. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that global risk of inflammatory disease does not strongly influence aging-related cognitive decline but that susceptibility variants that influence peripheral immune function also alter microglial density and immune gene expression in the aging brain, opening a new perspective on the control of microglial and immune responses within the central nervous system. Further study on the molecular mechanisms of peripheral immune disease risk influencing glial cell activation will be required to identify key regulators of these pathways.",24/07/2018,38,Mol Neurodegener,PubMed,PMID: 30041668 PMCID: PMC6057096,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30041668,"Alzheimer’s disease; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Genomics; Humans; Male; Genotype; Schizophrenia; Inflammation; RNA sequencing; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors; Microglia; Cognitive Dysfunction; Aging; Multifactorial Inheritance; Neuropathology; Multiple Sclerosis; Parkinson Disease; Genetic Variation; Innate immunity; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Polygenic score; Postmortem",

An integrated cross-platform analysis is expected to improve resolution and accuracy, yet there is no tool for effectively combining data from sequencing and array platforms. The detection of CNVs using sequencing data alone can also be further improved by the utilization of allele-specific reads. RESULTS: We propose a statistical framework, integrated CNV (iCNV) detection algorithm, which can be applied to multiple study designs: WES only, WGS only, SNP array only, or any combination of SNP and sequencing data. iCNV applies platform-specific normalization, utilizes allele specific reads from sequencing and integrates matched NGS and SNP-array data by a hidden Markov model. We compare integrated two-platform CNV detection using iCNV to naïve intersection or union of platforms and show that iCNV increases sensitivity and robustness. We also assess the accuracy of iCNV on WGS data only and show that the utilization of allele-specific reads improve CNV detection accuracy compared to existing methods.

Neurobiological mechanisms supporting temporal discounting have been explored among younger participants, and these have considered white matter integrity. However, the white matter correlates of temporal discounting in older adults are unclear. We hypothesized that greater temporal discounting would be associated with poorer white matter integrity measures, more specifically lower fractional anisotropy and higher trace, in older adults.

Temporal discounting was assessed using standard elicitation questions. White matter integrity was assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Regression models were adjusted for the effects of age, sex, education, and white matter lesions. Secondary models further adjusted for global cognition. Results revealed significant associations between temporal discounting and white matter integrity measures (FA and trace) in bilateral frontal, frontostriatal, and temporal-parietal lobe white matter tracts, and results remained significant after further accounting for global cognition.

Although there are sex differences in AD risk, sex differences have not been evaluated in genetic studies of AD endophenotypes. We performed sex-stratified and sex interaction genetic analyses of CSF biomarkers to identify sex-specific associations. Data came from a previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CSF Aβ42 and tau (1527 males, 1509 females). We evaluated sex interactions at previous loci, performed sex-stratified GWAS to identify sex-specific associations, and evaluated sex interactions at sex-specific GWAS loci. We then evaluated sex-specific associations between prefrontal cortex (PFC) gene expression at relevant loci and autopsy measures of plaques and tangles using data from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. In Aβ42, we observed sex interactions at one previous and one novel locus: rs316341 within SERPINB1 (p = 0.04) and rs13115400 near LINC00290 (p = 0.002). These loci showed stronger associations among females (β = - 0.03, p = 4.25 × 10-8; β = 0.03, p = 3.97 × 10-8) than males (β = - 0.02, p = 0.009; β = 0.01, p = 0.20). Higher levels of expression of SERPINB1, SERPINB6, and SERPINB9 in PFC was associated with higher levels of amyloidosis among females (corrected p values < 0.02) but not males (p > 0.38). In total tau, we observed a sex interaction at a previous locus, rs1393060 proximal to GMNC (p = 0.004), driven by a stronger association among females (β = 0.05, p = 4.57 × 10-10) compared to males (β = 0.02, p = 0.03).

METHODS: We used data from 1,362 autopsied participants of three community-based clinicopathological cohorts: the Religious Orders Study, the Rush Memory and Aging Project, and the Minority Aging Research Study. We estimated a series of structural equation models summarizing a priori hypothesized neuropathological pathways between age and dementia risk individually and collectively. RESULTS: At time of death (mean age, 89 years), 44% of our sample had a clinical dementia diagnosis. When considered individually, our vascular, amyloid/tau, neocortical Lewy body, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)/hippocampal sclerosis pathology pathways each accounted for a substantial proportion of the association between age and dementia. When considered collectively, the four pathways fully accounted for all variance in dementia risk previously attributable to age. Pathways involving amyloid/tau, neocortical Lewy bodies, and TDP-43/hippocampal sclerosis were interdependent, attributable to the importance of amyloid beta plaques in all three. The importance of the pathways varied, with the vascular pathway accounting for 32% of the association between age and dementia, wheraes the remaining three inter-related degenerative pathways together accounted for 68% (amyloid/tau, 24%; the Lewy body, 1%; and TDP-43/hippocampal sclerosis, 43%).

Emerging data suggest that financial literacy is an important determinant of health outcomes in old age, but the relationship with hospitalization has not been explored. OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that better financial literacy is related to lower risk of hospitalization in older persons. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Data came from community-dwelling older adults (n=388) without dementia enrolled in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. MAIN MEASURES: Participants underwent detailed assessment of financial literacy and cognition. Data on hospitalizations were obtained from linked Medicare claims records (MedPAR file). RESULTS: Over an average of 1.8 years, 117 participants (30%) were hospitalized, and a third of those hospitalized experienced multiple hospitalizations. In a modified Poisson regression model adjusted for age, sex, education, and cognition, better financial literacy was associated with lower risk of hospitalization. In a model further adjusted for income, physical activity, body mass index, smoking, social network size, chronic conditions, basic and instrumental activities of daily living disability, and depressive symptoms, the association was unchanged. Secondary analyses showed the association was primarily driven by conceptual knowledge rather than numeracy.

The current work targeted influential genes in this network with quantitative proteomics to identify potential novel therapeutic targets. METHODS: Data came from 834 community-based older persons who were followed annually, died, and underwent brain autopsy. Uniform structured postmortem evaluations assessed the burden of β-amyloid and other common age-related neuropathologies. Selected reaction monitoring quantified cortical protein abundance of 12 genes prioritized from a molecular network of aging human brain that is implicated in Alzheimer's dementia. Regression and linear mixed models examined the protein associations with β-amyloid load and other neuropathological indices as well as cognitive decline over multiple years preceding death. RESULTS: Average age at death was 88.6 years. Overall, 349 participants (41.9%) had Alzheimer's dementia at death. A higher level of PLXNB1 abundance was associated with more β-amyloid load (p = 1.0 × 10-7 ) and higher PHFtau tangle density (p = 2.3 × 10-7 ), and the association of PLXNB1 with cognitive decline is mediated by these known Alzheimer's disease pathologies. On the other hand, higher IGFBP5, HSPB2, and AK4 and lower ITPK1 levels were associated with faster cognitive decline, and, unlike PLXNB1, these associations were not fully explained by common neuropathological indices, suggesting novel mechanisms leading to cognitive decline.

Most analyses, however, consider only the marginal eQTL signal, rather than dissect this signal into multiple conditionally independent signals for each gene. Here we show that analyzing conditional eQTL signatures, which could be important under specific cellular or temporal contexts, leads to improved fine mapping of GWAS associations. Using genotypes and gene expression levels from post-mortem human brain samples (n = 467) reported by the CommonMind Consortium (CMC), we find that conditional eQTL are widespread; 63% of genes with primary eQTL also have conditional eQTL.

Diagnosis of dementia in the 1160 autopsied participants from 3 studies of community-dwelling elders was based on clinical evaluation and cognitive performance tests which were used to create summary measures of the five cognitive domains. Neuronal and glial TDP-43 cytoplasmic inclusions were quantitated in 8 brain regions by immunohistochemistry, and used in ANOVA and regression analyses. TDP-43 pathology was present in 547 (49.4%) participants in whom ATPC (41.9%) was the most frequently involved neocortical region and in 15.5% of these cases, ATPC was the only neocortical area with TDP-43 pathology suggesting not only that ATPC is involved early by TDP-43 but that ATPC may represent an intermediate stage between mesial temporal lobe involvement by TDP-43 and the last stage with involvement of other neocortical areas. To better study this intermediary neocortical stage, and to integrate with other staging schemes, our previous 3 stage distribution of TDP-43 pathology was revised to a 5 stage distribution scheme with stage 1 showing involvement of the amygdala only; stage 2 showed extension to hippocampus and/or entorhinal cortex; stage 3 showed extension to the ATPC; stage 4 - showed extension to the midtemporal cortex and/or OFC and finally in stage 5, there was extension to the midfrontal cortex. Clinically, cases in stages 2 to 5 had impaired episodic memory, however, stage 3 was distinct from stage 2 since stage 3 cases had significantly increased odds of dementia.

Yet limited work has evaluated the association between APOE alleles and markers of AD neuropathology in a sex-specific manner. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate sex differences in the association between APOE and markers of AD neuropathology measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during life or in brain tissue at autopsy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicohort study selected data from 10 longitudinal cohort studies of normal aging and AD. Cohorts had variable recruitment criteria and follow-up intervals and included population-based and clinic-based samples. Inclusion in our analysis required APOE genotype data and either CSF data available for analysis. Analyses began on November 6, 2017, and were completed on December 20, 2017. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Biomarker analyses included levels of β-amyloid 42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau measured in CSF. Autopsy analyses included Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease staging for neuritic plaques and Braak staging for neurofibrillary tangles. RESULTS: Of the 1798 patients in the CSF biomarker cohort, 862 were women, 226 had AD, 1690 were white, and the mean (SD) age was 70 [9] years. Of the 5109 patients in the autopsy cohort, 2813 were women, 4953 were white, and the mean (SD) age was 84 (9) years. After correcting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni procedure, we observed a statistically significant interaction between APOE-ε4 and sex on CSF total tau (β = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.27-0.55; P < .001) and phosphorylated tau (β = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.09-0.38; P = .001), whereby APOE showed a stronger association among women compared with men. Post hoc analyses suggested this sex difference was present in amyloid-positive individuals (β = 0.41; 95% CI, 0.20-0.62; P < .001) but not among amyloid-negative individuals (β = 0.06; 95% CI, -0.18 to 0.31; P = .62). We did not observe sex differences in the association between APOE and β-amyloid 42, neuritic plaque burden, or neurofibrillary tangle burden. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: We provide robust evidence of a stronger association between APOE-ε4 and CSF tau levels among women compared with men across multiple independent data sets. Interestingly, APOE-ε4 is not differentially associated with autopsy measures of neurofibrillary tangles. Together, the sex difference in the association between APOE and CSF measures of tau and the lack of a sex difference in the association with neurofibrillary tangles at autopsy suggest that APOE may modulate risk for neurodegeneration in a sex-specific manner, particularly in the presence of amyloidosis.",01/08/2018,989-998,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 29801024 PMCID: PMC6142927,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29801024,"Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Genotype; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Peptide Fragments; Sex Factors; Alzheimer Disease; Plaque, Amyloid; Neurofibrillary Tangles; tau Proteins; Apolipoproteins E; Phosphoproteins",

Multiple regression analyses controlling for age and sex were used to examine the relation of brain indexes to total daily physical activity and other clinical covariates proximate to death. RESULTS: Average total daily activity was 1.53 × 105 counts/d (SD 1.14 × 105 counts/d), and mean age at death was 90.6 (SD 6.12) years.

Using an innovative two-step process, we develop a new epigenetic biomarker of aging, DNAm PhenoAge, that strongly outperforms previous measures in regards to predictions for a variety of aging outcomes, including all-cause mortality, cancers, healthspan, physical functioning, and Alzheimer's disease. While this biomarker was developed using data from whole blood, it correlates strongly with age in every tissue and cell tested. Based on an in-depth transcriptional analysis in sorted cells, we find that increased epigenetic, relative to chronological age, is associated with increased activation of pro-inflammatory and interferon pathways, and decreased activation of transcriptional/translational machinery, DNA damage response, and mitochondrial signatures.

METHODS: Participants (n = 608) were older adults participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a community-based cohort study of aging. Objective measures of total daily physical activity were derived from a wearable device. Gait and balance abilities were objectively quantified using a body-fixed sensor. We also collected measures of other motor functions, cognitive and psychosocial factors, and chronic health. We employed linear regression models to identify facets of mobility significantly associated with total daily physical activity, and tested for independence of these associations when all significant covariates were considered together in a final model. RESULTS: Three gait and balance measures were independently associated with total daily physical activity (p < .01), together accounting for approximately 16% of its variance.

In the current study, we use path analysis to examine the direct and indirect pathways linking age, education, cognition, literacy, and risk aversion with decision making. We also decomposed literacy into its subcomponents, conceptual knowledge and numeracy, in order to examine their associations with decision making. METHOD: Participants were 937 community-based older adults without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project who completed a battery of cognitive tests and assessments of healthcare and financial decision making, health and financial literacy, and risk aversion. RESULTS: Age and education exerted effects on decision making, but nearly two thirds of their effects were indirect, working mostly through cognition and literacy. Cognition exerted a strong direct effect on decision making and a robust indirect effect working primarily through literacy. Literacy also exerted a powerful direct effect on decision making, as did its subcomponents, conceptual knowledge and numeracy. The direct effect of risk aversion was comparatively weak. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to cognition, health and financial literacy emerged as independent and primary correlates of healthcare and financial decision making.

The advent of low-cost, whole-genome sequencing facilitates high-resolution variant identification, and the development of linear mixed models (LMM) allows improved identification of putatively causal variants. While essential for correcting false positive associations due to sample relatedness and population stratification, LMMs have commonly been restricted to quantitative variables. However, phenotypic traits in association studies are often categorical, coded as binary case-control or ordered variables describing disease stages. To address these issues, we have devised a method for genomic association studies that implements a generalized LMM (GLMM) in a Bayesian framework, called Bayes-GLMM Bayes-GLMM has four major features: (1) support of categorical, binary, and quantitative variables; (2) cohesive integration of previous GWAS results for related traits; (3) correction for sample relatedness by mixed modeling; and (4) model estimation by both Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling and maximal likelihood estimation. We applied Bayes-GLMM to the whole-genome sequencing cohort of the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project. This study contains 570 individuals from 111 families, each with Alzheimer's disease diagnosed at one of four confidence levels. Using Bayes-GLMM we identified four variants in three loci significantly associated with Alzheimer's disease. Two variants, rs140233081 and rs149372995, lie between PRKAR1B and PDGFA The coded proteins are localized to the glial-vascular unit, and PDGFA transcript levels are associated with Alzheimer's disease-related neuropathology.

Because animal models fail to fully recapitulate the complexity of human brain aging, postmortem studies from well-designed cohorts are crucial to unmask mechanisms conferring cognitive resistance against cumulative neuropathologies. We tested the hypothesis that functionality of the SNARE protein interactome might be an important resilience factor preserving cognitive abilities in old age. Cognition was assessed annually in participants from the Rush ""Memory and Aging Project"" (MAP), a community-dwelling cohort representative of the overall aging population. Associations between cognition and postmortem neurochemical data were evaluated in functional assays quantifying various species of the SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) machinery in samples from the inferior temporal (IT, n = 154) and middle-frontal (MF, n = 174) gyri. Using blue-native gel electrophoresis, we isolated and quantified several types of complexes containing the three SNARE proteins (syntaxin-1, SNAP25, VAMP), as well as the GABAergic/glutamatergic selectively expressed complexins-I/II (CPLX1/2), in brain tissue homogenates and reconstitution assays with recombinant proteins. Multivariate analyses revealed significant associations between IT and MF neurochemical data (SNARE proteins and/or complexes), and multiple age-related neuropathologies, as well as with multiple cognitive domains of MAP participants. Controlling for demographic variables, neuropathologic indices and total synapse density, we found that temporal 150-kDa SNARE species (representative of pan-synaptic functionality) and frontal CPLX1/CPLX2 ratio of 500-kDa heteromeric species (representative of inhibitory/excitatory input functionality) were, among all the immunocharacterized complexes, the strongest predictors of cognitive function nearest death. Interestingly, these two neurochemical variables were associated with different cognitive domains. In addition, linear mixed effect models of global cognitive decline estimated that both 150-kDa SNARE levels and CPLX1/CPLX2 ratio were associated with better cognition and less decline over time. The results are consistent with previous studies reporting that synapse dysfunction (i.e. dysplasticity) may be initiated early, and relatively independent of neuropathology-driven synapse loss.

SETTING: Community-based cohorts from Chicago and northeastern Illinois and religious clergymen from across the United States constituted the primary population. A representative sample of the U.S. population was used for secondary analyses. PARTICIPANTS: 3054 African Americans (AAs) and 9304 European Americans (EAs). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Incident AD.

METHODS: A total of 4,015 community-based persons (28% black; 74% women; mean baseline age = 78 years) were enrolled in 1 of 4 longitudinal cohort studies, and another 2,937 in a population-based cohort. Memory scores, assessed using 2 questions (5-point Likert scales) were categorized as complaints present or absent. Global cognition and 5 cognitive domains were derived from annual neuropsychological tests. Dementia was assessed from these tests and additional data. Neuropathologic data were available for 1,350 deceased subjects with brain autopsies. Regression and mixed effects models were used to examine relationships of memory complaints to cognition and neuropathology. RESULTS: Baseline memory complaints (n = 1,310; 33% of 4,015) were associated with lower cognition and faster decline in all domains (global score estimate = -0.032, standard error = 0.004, p < 0.0001), during a mean follow-up of 6 (standard deviation = 2) years. Persons with memory complaints had higher dementia risk (hazard ratio = 1.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.42-1.89) and odds of pathologic Alzheimer disease (odds ratio [OR] = 1.96, 95% CI = 1.51-2.54), neocortical Lewy bodies (OR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.54-3.96), and other neurodegenerative pathologies.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the magnitude of amyloid-related functional decline and to identify the functional domains sensitive to decline in a preclinical AD population. METHODS: Data were from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Cognitive decline was measured by a modified version of the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite. The trajectories of functional decline, as measured by the instrumental and basic activities of daily living, were longitudinally modeled in 484 participants without cognitive impairment at baseline and having both a final clinical and a postmortem neuropathology assessment of AD. RESULTS: Individuals with different final clinical diagnoses had different trajectories of cognitive and functional decline. Individuals with AD dementia, minor cognitive impairment, and no cognitive impairment had the most, intermediate, and least declines. While individuals with pathologic AD had significantly more cognitive decline over time than those without, the magnitude of difference in functional decline between these two groups was small. Functional domains such as handling finance and handling medications were more sensitive to decline.

Here, we report that aged tau-overexpressing mice develop changes to blood vessels including abnormal, spiraling morphologies; reduced blood vessel diameters; and increased overall blood vessel density in cortex. Blood flow in these vessels was altered, with periods of obstructed flow rarely observed in normal capillaries. These changes were accompanied by cortical atrophy as well as increased expression of angiogenesis-related genes such as Vegfa, Serpine1, and Plau in CD31-positive endothelial cells. Interestingly, mice overexpressing nonmutant forms of tau in the absence of frank neurodegeneration also demonstrated similar changes. Furthermore, many of the genes we observe in mice are also altered in human RNA datasets from Alzheimer patients, particularly in brain regions classically associated with tau pathology such as the temporal lobe and limbic system regions.

METHODS: A candidate-gene approach tested the association between 5 genes (28 single nucleotide polymorphisms) and Aβ load measured in vivo by the global [18F]florbetapir PET standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) in 338 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants. Significant results were then tested using plasma Aβ and CSF Aβ and Aβ/phosphorylated tau (Aβ/p-tau) ratio in the same cohort. The significant association was also generalized to postmortem Aβ load measurement in the Rush Religious Orders Study/Memory and Aging Project cohorts. In addition, global cognition was used as a phenotype in the analysis in both cohorts. RESULTS: Analysis of Aβ PET identified a variant in the CYP2C19 gene (rs4388808; p = 0.0006), in which carriers of the minor allele (MA) had a lower global SUVR. A voxel-wise analysis revealed that the variant is associated with a lower Aβ load in the frontal, inferior temporal, and posterior cingulate cortices. MA carriers also had higher CSF Aβ (p = 0.003) and Aβ/p-tau ratio (p = 0.02) but had no association with Aβ plasma levels. In postmortem brains, MA carriers had a lower Aβ load (p = 0.03). Global cognition was higher in MA carriers, which was found to be mediated by Aβ. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these findings point to an association between CYP2C19 polymorphism and Aβ pathology, suggesting a protective effect of the MA of rs4388808.

Despite their significant progresses in genetic research, understanding the etiology and mechanism of complex phenotypes remains elusive. Using association analysis as a major analytical platform for the complex data analysis is a key issue that hampers the theoretic development of genomic science and its application in practice. Causal inference is an essential component for the discovery of mechanical relationships among complex phenotypes. Many researchers suggest making the transition from association to causation. Despite its fundamental role in science, engineering, and biomedicine, the traditional methods for causal inference require at least three variables. However, quantitative genetic analysis such as QTL, eQTL, mQTL, and genomic-imaging data analysis requires exploring the causal relationships between two variables. This paper will focus on bivariate causal discovery with continuous variables. We will introduce independence of cause and mechanism (ICM) as a basic principle for causal inference, algorithmic information theory and additive noise model (ANM) as major tools for bivariate causal discovery. Large-scale simulations will be performed to evaluate the feasibility of the ANM for bivariate causal discovery. To further evaluate their performance for causal inference, the ANM will be applied to the construction of gene regulatory networks. Also, the ANM will be applied to trait-imaging data analysis to illustrate three scenarios: presence of both causation and association, presence of association while absence of causation, and presence of causation, while lack of association between two variables. Telling cause from effect between two continuous variables from observational data is one of the fundamental and challenging problems in omics and imaging data analysis. Our preliminary simulations and real data analysis will show that the ANMs will be one of choice for bivariate causal discovery in genomic and imaging data analysis.",2018,347,Front Genet,PubMed,PMID: 30233639 PMCID: PMC6127271,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30233639,gene expression; additive noise models; algorithmic information theory; genome-wide causal studies; imaging data analysis; independence of cause and mechanism (ICM),

While Alzheimer's dementia risk has a substantial genetic component, the specific molecular mechanisms and neuropathologies triggered by most of the known genetic variants are unclear. Resultantly, they have shown limited influence on drug development portfolios to date. To facilitate our understanding of the consequences of Alzheimer's dementia susceptibility variants, we examined their relationship to a wide range of clinical, molecular and neuropathological features. Because the effect size of individual variants is typically small, we utilized a polygenic (overall) risk approach to identify the global impact of Alzheimer's dementia susceptibility variants. Under this approach, each individual has a polygenic risk score (PRS) that we related to clinical, molecular and neuropathological phenotypes. Applying this approach to 1,272 individuals who came to autopsy from one of two longitudinal aging cohorts, we observed that an individual's PRS was associated with cognitive decline and brain pathologies including beta-amyloid, tau-tangles, hippocampal sclerosis, and TDP-43, MIR132, four proteins including VGF, IGFBP5, and STX1A, and many chromosomal regions decorated with acetylation on histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9Ac). While excluding the APOE/TOMM40 region (containing the single largest genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's dementia) in the calculation of the PRS resulted in a slightly weaker association with the molecular signatures, results remained significant. These PRS-associated brain pathologies and molecular signatures appear to mediate genetic risk, as they attenuated the association of the PRS with cognitive decline. Notably, the PRS induced changes in H3K9Ac throughout the genome, implicating it in large-scale chromatin changes. Thus, the PRS for Alzheimer's dementia (AD-PRS) showed effects on diverse clinical, molecular, and pathological systems, ranging from the epigenome to specific proteins. These convergent targets of a large number of genetic risk factors for Alzheimer's dementia will help define the experimental systems and models needed to test therapeutic targets, which are expected to be broadly effective in the aging population that carries diverse genetic risks for Alzheimer's dementia.",2018,699,Front Neurosci,PubMed,PMID: 30349450 PMCID: PMC6187226,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30349450,Alzheimer's disease; polygenic risk score; epigenome; brain pathology; lifestyle; multi omics; personality; PheWAS,

We calculated the age-specific annual incidence rates of dementia in the non-demented elderly (n = 10,220). Two major episodic memory trajectories were estimated: 1) Stable-consisting of individuals exhibiting a constant or improved memory function, and 2) Decliner-consisting of individuals whose memory function declined. The majority of the study participants maintain their memory performance over time. Compared to those with Stable trajectory, individuals characterized as Decliners were more likely to have non-white ethnic background, fewer years of education, a higher frequency of ε4 allele at APOE gene and five times more likely to develop dementia.

In this study, we examined the association of a diet specifically developed to promote brain health, called MIND (Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay), to the incidence and progression of parkinsonism in older adults. METHODS: A total of 706 Memory and Aging Project participants aged 59 -97 years and without parkinsonism at baseline were assessed annually for the presence of four parkinsonian signs using a 26-item modified version of the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. Incident parkinsonism was defined as the first occurrence over 4.6 years of follow-up of two or more parkinsonian signs. The progression of parkinsonism was assessed by change in a global parkinsonian score (range: 0-100). MIND, Mediterranean, and DASH diet pattern scores were computed based on a validated food frequency questionnaire including 144 food items. We employed Cox-Proportional Hazard models and linear mixed models, to examine the associations of baseline diet scores with incident parkinsonism and the annual rate of change in global parkinsonian score, respectively. RESULTS: In models adjusted for age, sex, smoking, total energy intake, BMI and depressive symptoms, higher MIND diet scores were associated with a decreased risk of parkinsonism [(HR=0.89, 95% CI 0.83-0.96)]; and a slower rate of parkinsonism progression [(β= -0.008; SE=0.0037; p=0.04)]. The Mediterranean diet was marginally associated with reduced parkinsonism progression (β= -0.002; SE=0.0014; p=0.06). The DASH diet, by contrast, was not associated with either outcome.

We aimed to study, on a genome-wide level, if genetic correlation and pleiotropic loci exist between depressive symptoms and T2D or glycemic traits. METHODS: We estimated single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability and analyzed genetic correlation between depressive symptoms and T2D and glycemic traits with the linkage disequilibrium score regression by combining summary statistics of previously conducted meta-analyses for depressive symptoms by CHARGE consortium (N = 51,258), T2D by DIAGRAM consortium (N = 34,840 patients and 114,981 controls), fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostatic model assessment of β-cell function and insulin resistance by MAGIC consortium (N = 58,074). Finally, we investigated pleiotropic loci using a bivariate genome-wide association study approach with summary statistics from genome-wide association study meta-analyses and reported loci with genome-wide significant bivariate association p value (p < 5 × 10). Biological annotation and function of significant pleiotropic SNPs were assessed in several databases. RESULTS: The SNP-based heritability ranged from 0.04 to 0.10 in each individual trait. In the linkage disequilibrium score regression analyses, depressive symptoms showed no significant genetic correlation with T2D or glycemic traits (p > 0.37).

CONCLUSIONS: We found no significant overall genetic correlations between depressive symptoms, T2D, or glycemic traits suggesting major differences in underlying biology of these traits.

In order to be able to translate the ex-vivo QSM findings to in-vivo, it is crucial to understand the effects of death and chemical fixation on brain magnetic susceptibility measurements collected ex-vivo. Thus, the objective of this work was twofold: a) to assess the behavior of magnetic susceptibility in both gray and white matter of human brain hemispheres as a function of time postmortem, and b) to establish the relationship between in-vivo and ex-vivo gray matter susceptibility measurements on the same hemispheres. Five brain hemispheres from community-dwelling older adults were imaged ex-vivo with QSM on a weekly basis for six weeks postmortem, and the longitudinal behavior of ex-vivo magnetic susceptibility in both gray and white matter was assessed. The relationship between in-vivo and ex-vivo gray matter susceptibility measurements was investigated using QSM data from eleven older adults imaged both antemortem and postmortem. No systematic change in ex-vivo magnetic susceptibility of gray or white matter was observed over time postmortem. Additionally, it was demonstrated that, gray matter magnetic susceptibility measured ex-vivo may be well modeled as a linear function of susceptibility measured in-vivo. In conclusion, magnetic susceptibility in gray and white matter measured ex-vivo with QSM does not systematically change in the first six weeks after death. This information is important for future cross-sectional ex-vivo QSM studies of hemispheres imaged at different postmortem intervals.

We then used this model system to perform an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) study examining 94 genes from loci associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.

In the PILRB and LRRK2 loci, the cis-eQTL was found in the MDMi cells but not in human peripheral blood monocytes, suggesting that differentiation of monocytes into microglia-like cells led to the acquisition of a cellular state that could reveal the functional consequences of certain genetic variants. We further validated the effect of risk haplotypes at the protein level for PILRB and CD33, and we confirmed that the CD33 risk haplotype altered phagocytosis by the MDMi cells.

We quantified the contribution of 9 neuropathologies to cognitive loss at an individual level. METHODS: Participants (n = 1,079) came from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathologic studies of aging. All completed 2 + cognitive evaluations (maximum = 22), died, and underwent neuropathologic examinations to identify Alzheimer disease (AD), other neurodegenerative diseases, and vascular pathologies. Linear mixed models examined associations of neuropathologies with cognitive decline and estimated the proportion of cognitive loss accounted for by each neuropathology at a person-specific level. RESULTS: Neuropathology was ubiquitous, with 94% of participants having 1+, 78% having 2+, 58% having 3+, and 35% having 4+. AD was most frequent (65%) but rarely occurred in isolation (9%). Remarkably, >230 different neuropathologic combinations were observed, each of which occurred in <6% of the cohort. The relative contributions of specific neuropathologies to cognitive loss varied widely across individuals. Although AD accounted for an average of about 50% of the observed cognitive loss, the proportion accounted for at the individual level ranged widely from 22% to 100%.

Dendritic spine structure is defined by filamentous actin (F-actin) and we observed depolymerization of synaptosomal F-actin accompanied by increased globular-actin (G-actin) at as early as 1 month of age in a mouse model of AD (APPswe/PS1ΔE9, male mice). This led to recall deficit after contextual fear conditioning (cFC) at 2 months of age in APPswe/PS1ΔE9 male mice, which could be reversed by the actin-polymerizing agent jasplakinolide. Further, the F-actin-depolymerizing agent latrunculin induced recall deficit after cFC in WT mice, indicating the importance of maintaining F-/G-actin equilibrium for optimal behavioral response. Using direct stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (dSTORM), we show that F-actin depolymerization in spines leads to a breakdown of the nano-organization of outwardly radiating F-actin rods in cortical neurons from APPswe/PS1ΔE9 mice. Our results demonstrate that synaptic dysfunction seen as F-actin disassembly occurs very early, before onset of pathological hallmarks in AD mice, and contributes to behavioral dysfunction, indicating that depolymerization of F-actin is causal and not consequent to decreased spine density. Further, we observed decreased synaptosomal F-actin levels in postmortem brain from mild cognitive impairment and AD patients compared with subjects with normal cognition. F-actin decrease correlated inversely with increasing AD pathology (Braak score, Aβ load, and tangle density) and directly with performance in episodic and working memory tasks, suggesting its role in human disease pathogenesis and progression.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Synaptic dysfunction underlies cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The cytoskeletal protein actin plays a critical role in maintaining structure and function of synapses. Using cultured neurons and an AD mouse model, we show for the first time that filamentous actin (F-actin) is lost selectively from synapses early in the disease process, long before the onset of classical AD pathology. We also demonstrate that loss of synaptic F-actin contributes directly to memory deficits. Loss of synaptosomal F-actin in human postmortem tissue correlates directly with decreased performance in memory test and inversely with AD pathology. Our data highlight that synaptic cytoarchitectural changes occur early in AD and they may be targeted for the development of therapeutics.",31/01/2018,1085-1099,J Neurosci,PubMed,PMID: 29246925 PMCID: PMC5792472,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246925,"Female; Humans; Male; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Mice; Actins; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Alzheimer Disease; cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; dementia; Aging; Autopsy; Mice, Transgenic; neurodegenerative disease; Cognition Disorders; Synaptosomes; Dendritic Spines; Mental Recall; Primary Cell Culture; Actin Depolymerizing Factors; Conditioning, Classical; cytoskeleton; Fear",

However, there is currently no overview of the existing longitudinal real world data sources in Parkinson's disease (PD) in the USA. Such an assessment can be very helpful, to support a future effort to harmonize real world data collection and use the available resources in an optimal way. METHODS: The objective of this comprehensive literature review is to systematically identify and describe the longitudinal, real world data sources in PD in the USA, and to provide a summary of their measurements (categorized into 8 main dimensions: motor and neurological functions, cognition, psychiatry, activities of daily living, sleep, quality of life, autonomic symptoms and other). The literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and internet key word search. RESULTS: Of the 53 data sources identified between May and August 2016, 16 were still ongoing. Current medications (81%) and comorbidities (79%) were frequently collected, in comparison to medical imaging (36%), genetic information (30%), caregiver burden (11%) and healthcare costs (2%). Many different measurements (n = 108) were performed and an interesting variability among used measurements was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: Many longitudinal real world data sources on PD exist. Different types of measurements have been performed over time.

We aimed to use decline in PCC glucose metabolism as a proxy for the development and progression of AD to discover common genetic variants associated with disease vulnerability. METHODS: We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of decline in PCC fludeoxyglucose F 18 ([18 F] FDG) positron emission tomography measured in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (n = 606). We then performed follow-up analyses to assess the impact of significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on disease risk and longitudinal cognitive performance in a large independent data set (n = 870). Last, we assessed whether significant SNP influence gene expression using two RNA sequencing data sets (n = 210 and n = 159). RESULTS: We demonstrate a novel genome-wide significant association between rs2273647-T in the gene, PPP4R3A, and reduced [18 F] FDG decline (p = 4.44 × 10-8 ). In a follow-up analysis using an independent data set, we demonstrate a protective effect of this variant against risk of conversion to MCI or AD (p = 0.038) and against cognitive decline in individuals who develop dementia (p = 3.41 × 10-15 ). Furthermore, this variant is associated with altered gene expression in peripheral blood and altered PPPP4R3A transcript expression in temporal cortex, suggesting a role at the molecular level. INTERPRETATIONS: PPP4R3A is a gene involved in AD risk and progression. Given the protective effect of this variant, PPP4R3A should be further investigated as a gene of interest in neurodegenerative diseases and as a potential target for AD therapies.

In CN and MCI individuals, we found that amyloid and total tau positivity systematically varies as a function of PHS.

The extent to which individuals with no cognitive impairment (NCI) possess serum anti-tau antibodies, and whether their concentrations of these antibodies differ from anti-tau antibody levels in persons with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD, are unclear. Previous studies measuring these antibodies did not account for antibody polyvalent binding, which can be extensive, nor that antibody binding to phosphorylated tau peptides could be due to binding to non-phosphorylated epitopes on those peptides. METHODS: An ELISA controlling for these factors was used to measure the specific binding of serum IgG and IgM to phosphorylated (""pTau;"" phosphorylated at Serine-199 and Serine-202) and non-phosphorylated (""non-pTau"") tau 196-207 in subjects with NCI, MCI, or AD (n = 10/group). Between-group differences in these antibody levels were evaluated for statistical significance, and correlations were examined in pooled data from all subjects between these antibody levels and subject age, global cognitive functioning, and NFT counts. RESULTS: Specific IgG binding to pTau and non-pTau was detected in all subjects except for one NCI control. Specific IgM binding was detected to pTau in all subjects except for two AD patients, and to non-pTau in all subjects. Mean pTau IgG was increased in MCI subjects by 53% and 70% vs. AD and NCI subjects respectively (both p < 0.05), while no significant differences were found between groups for non-pTau IgG (p = 0.052), pTau IgM, or non-pTau IgM. Non-pTau IgG was negatively associated with global cognition (Spearman rho = -0.50). CONCLUSIONS: Specific binding of serum IgG and IgM to phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated tau may be present in older persons regardless of their cognitive status. Serum IgG to phosphorylated tau may be increased in individuals with MCI, but this unexpected finding requires confirmation. The approach used in this study to measure specific serum antibodies to phosphorylated tau should be useful for measuring antibodies to other post-translationally-modified proteins that are of relevance to neurodegenerative disorders.",2017,32,Transl Neurodegener,PubMed,PMID: 29204273 PMCID: PMC5701435,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29204273,Alzheimer’s disease; Antibodies; Mild cognitive impairment; Elisa ELISA; Phosphorylated tau,

Here, we examine neurons derived from iPSCs of patients harboring an amyloid precursor protein mutation to quantify AD-relevant phenotypes following directed differentiation to rostral fates of the brain (vulnerable) and caudal fates (relatively spared) in AD. We find that both the generation of Aβ and the responsiveness of TAU to Aβ are affected by neuronal cell type, with rostral neurons being more sensitive than caudal neurons.

However, there are few data concerning the relationship between objectively quantified sleep disruption and the cardinal histopathological features of PD, especially in individuals without clinical PD. METHODS: We studied 269 older adults without PD who had participated in the Rush Memory and Aging Project and undergone uniform structured neuropathologic evaluations upon death. Sleep fragmentation was measured using actigraphy. Logistic regression models examined the associations of sleep fragmentation proximate to death with the burden of Lewy body pathology and substantia nigra neuron loss. RESULTS: Greater sleep fragmentation was associated with the presence of Lewy body pathology (odds ratio 1.40; 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.86; P = .02) and substantia nigra neuron loss (odds ratio 1.43; 95% confidence interval 1.10-1.88; P = .008) and a higher odds of a pathological diagnosis of PD (odds ratio 2.04; 95% confidence interval 1.34-3.16; P = .0009). These associations were independent of motor features of parkinsonism, demographic characteristics, and a wide range of medical co-morbidities.

However, the underlying neurobiology of this association is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between brain gene expression, DNA methylation, and alteration of magnetic resonance imaging transverse relaxation in late-life cognitive decline. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data came from 2 community-based longitudinal cohort studies of aging and dementia, the Religious Orders Study, which began in 1993, and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, which began in 1997. All participants agreed to undergo annual clinical evaluations and to donate their brains after death. By October 24, 2016, a total of 1358 individuals had died and had brain autopsies that were approved by board-certified neuropathologists. Of those, 552 had undergone ex vivo imaging. The gene expression analysis was limited to 174 individuals with both imaging and brain RNA sequencing data. The DNA methylation analysis was limited to 225 individuals with both imaging and brain methylation data. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Maps of ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging transverse relaxation were generated using fast spin echo imaging. The target was a composite measure of the transverse relaxation rate (R2) that was associated with cognitive decline after controlling for common neuropathologic conditions. Next-generation RNA sequencing and DNA methylation data were generated using frozen tissue from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Genome-wide association analysis was used to investigate gene expression and, separately, DNA methylation for signals associated with the R2 measure. RESULTS: Of the 552 individuals with ex vivo imaging data, 394 were women and 158 were men, and the mean (SD) age at death was 90.4 (6.0) years.

METHODS: Whole-exome sequencing (WES) was completed in 110 individuals from 31 Caribbean Hispanic families without APOE ε4 homozygous carriers. Rare coding mutations segregating in families were subsequently genotyped in additional families and in an independent cohort of Caribbean Hispanic patients and controls. SRCAP messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was assessed in whole blood from mutation carriers with LOAD, noncarriers with LOAD, and healthy elderly controls, and also from autopsied brains in 2 clinical neuropathologic cohort studies of aging and dementia. RESULTS: Ten ultra-rare missense mutations in the Snf2-related CREBBP, activator protein (SRCAP), were found in 12 unrelated families. Compared with the frequency in Caribbean Hispanic controls and the Latino population in the Exome Aggregation Consortium, the frequency of SRCAP mutations among Caribbean Hispanic patients with LOAD was significantly enriched (p = 1.19e-16). mRNA expression of SRCAP in whole blood was significantly lower in mutation carriers with LOAD, while the expression in whole blood and in the brain was significantly higher in nonmutation carriers with LOAD. Brain expression also correlated with clinical and neuropathologic endophenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: WES in Caribbean Hispanic families with LOAD revealed ultra-rare missense mutations in SRCAP, a gene expressed in the brain and mutated in Floating-Harbor syndrome.

We studied 162 prospective autopsies from older adults with PD (N = 6) and without PD (N = 156). We documented the presence of LBs in cerebrum and brainstem structures from each of the six regions used for Braak PD staging and four spinal cord levels (C5/6, T7, L4/5 and S4/5). Parkinsonism proximate to death was based on a previously validated measure present if two or more of the four signs of parkinsonism were present based on a modified version of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Fifty-three of 156 individuals without PD (34%) had LBs in a least one site within the CNS. About half of cases with LBs in the cerebrum or brainstem, (25/53, 47%) also had spinal LBs. Almost 90% (22/25, 88%) of cases with spinal LBs had LBs in the cerebrum (Braak stages 4-6) and about 10% (3/25, 12%) had only brainstem LBs (Braak stages 1-3). Four of six cases with PD showed LBs in cerebrum, brainstem and spinal cord. Individuals with LBs in the spinal cord were more likely to have clinical parkinsonism proximate to death compared to individuals with LBs in brainstem and cerebrum alone (52% vs. 32%; Chi-Square x2  = 5.368, d.f. = 1, P = 0.0.021) and more severe nigral neuronal loss (48% vs. 11%; Chi-Square x2  = 9.049, d.f. = 1, P = 0.003). These findings were unchanged when we included cases with a history of PD.

We characterized spinal cord microvascular pathologies and examined their associations with other spinal and brain postmortem indices and parkinsonism in older adults. METHODS: We documented 3 features of microvascular pathologies in spinal cord and brain specimens from 165 deceased older participants. We also measured spinal white matter pallor. Parkinsonian signs were assessed with a modified version of the motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. We examined the associations of spinal arteriolosclerosis with other spinal and brain postmortem indices and parkinsonism proximate to death using regression models which controlled for age and sex. RESULTS: Microinfarcts and cerebral amyloid angiopathy were not observed within the spinal cord parenchyma. Spinal arteriolosclerosis was observed at all spinal levels (C7, T7, L4, S4) examined and was more severe posteriorly than anteriorly (posterior: 4.3, SD=0.72 versus anterior: 3.9, SD=0.74; t=14.58; P<0.001). Arteriolosclerosis was more severe in the spinal cord than in the brain (cord: 4.10, SD=0.70; brain: 3.5, SD=0.98; t=10.39; P<0.001). The severity of spinal arteriolosclerosis was associated with spinal white matter pallor (r=0.47; P<0.001). Spinal arteriolosclerosis accounted for ≈3% of the variation in parkinsonism in models controlling for age, sex, brain arteriolosclerosis, and cerebrovascular disease pathologies. Further models showed that the association of spinal arteriolosclerosis and parkinsonism was not mediated via spinal white matter pallor. CONCLUSIONS: Although the regional distribution of microvascular pathologies varies within the central nervous system, spinal arteriolosclerosis is common and may contribute to the severity of spinal white matter pallor and parkinsonism in older adults.",2017-10,2792-2798,Stroke,PubMed,PMID: 28931619 PMCID: PMC5659359,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28931619,"Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Follow-Up Studies; Brain; aging; Aging; Parkinsonian Disorders; cerebrovascular disease; parkinsonism; arteriolosclerosis; Arteriolosclerosis; Spinal Cord; Microvessels; spinal cord",

We examine relations of BMI with decline in global cognition and five cognitive domains, in older blacks and whites, and determine whether relations differ by race. METHODS: Participants were 2,134 persons without baseline dementia (33% black; 75% women; mean age =77.9 [range 53-100] and education = 14.7 years, Mini-Mental State Examination = 28.0), enrolled in one of two longitudinal, community-based cohort studies of aging (Minority Aging Research Study; Rush Memory and Aging Project). Summary scores of global cognition and five domains were based on 19 neuropsychological tests administered annually. Mixed-effects models, controlling for age, sex, education, and race, were used to examine the relation of baseline BMI to change in cognition. RESULTS: Baseline BMI = 28.4 units (30.3 in blacks [95% confidence interval (CI): 27.2-27.7]; 27.4 in whites [95% CI: 29.8-30.7]). During a mean annual follow-up of 6 years (SD = 4), lower baseline BMI was related to faster decline in global cognition (p = .002), and semantic memory (p < .001) and episodic memory (p = .004), but not working memory, perceptual speed, or visuospatial ability (all p > .08). The relationship of BMI with change in cognition was not modified by race (all p > .09).

METHODS: We used data from deceased individuals of European descent who participated in the Religious Orders Study or the Rush Memory and Aging Project (n = 1,288). We examined whether there were associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within ±100 kb of the UNC5C gene and a diagnosis of AD dementia, global cognitive decline, a pathologic diagnosis of AD, β-amyloid load, neuritic plaque count, diffuse plaque count, paired helical filament tau density, neurofibrillary tangle count, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) score. We also evaluated the relation of the CAA-associated variant and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) UNC5C RNA expression. Secondary analyses were performed to examine the interaction of the CAA-associated SNP and known genetic risk factors of CAA as well as the association of the SNP with other cerebrovascular pathologies. RESULTS: A set of UNC5C SNPs tagged by rs28660566T was associated with a higher CAA score (p = 2.3 × 10-6): each additional rs28660566T allele was associated with a 0.60 point higher CAA score, which is equivalent to approximately 75% of the higher CAA score associated with each allele of APOE ε4. rs28660566T was weakly associated with lower UNC5C expression in the human DLPFC (p = 0.036). Moreover, rs28660566T had a synergistic interaction with APOE ε4 on their association with higher CAA severity (p = 0.027) and was associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis (p = 0.0065).

METHODS: We report analyses of expression profiling of miRNA (n = 700 subjects) and lincRNA (n = 540 subjects) from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of individuals participating in two longitudinal cohort studies of aging. RESULTS: We confirm the association of two well-established miRNA (miR-132, miR-129) with pathologic AD in our dataset and then further characterize this association in terms of its component neuritic β-amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangle pathologies. Additionally, we identify one new miRNA (miR-99) and four lincRNA that are associated with these traits. Many other previously reported associations of microRNA with AD are associated with the confounders quantified in our longitudinal cohort. Finally, by performing analyses integrating both miRNA and RNA sequence data from the same individuals (525 samples), we characterize the impact of AD associated miRNA on human brain expression: we show that the effects of miR-132 and miR-129-5b converge on certain genes such as EP300 and find a role for miR200 and its target genes in AD using an integrated miRNA/mRNA analysis.

In mice, we represented spatial and temporal gait parameters as a function of velocity and established regression models that reproducibly capture the signatures of these relationships during walking. In experimental parkinsonism models, regression curves representing these relationships shifted from baseline, implicating changes in gait signatures, but with marked differences between models.

Genetic studies using intermediate quantitative traits such as biomarkers, or endophenotypes, benefit from increased statistical power to identify variants that may not pass the stringent multiple test correction in case-control studies. Endophenotypes also contain additional information helpful for identifying variants and genes associated with other aspects of disease, such as rate of progression or onset, and provide context to interpret the results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We conducted GWAS of amyloid beta (Aβ42), tau, and phosphorylated tau (ptau181) levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from 3146 participants across nine studies to identify novel variants associated with AD. Five genome-wide significant loci (two novel) were associated with ptau181, including loci that have also been associated with AD risk or brain-related phenotypes. Two novel loci associated with Aβ42 near GLIS1 on 1p32.3 (β = -0.059, P = 2.08 × 10-8) and within SERPINB1 on 6p25 (β = -0.025, P = 1.72 × 10-8) were also associated with AD risk (GLIS1: OR = 1.105, P = 3.43 × 10-2), disease progression (GLIS1: β = 0.277, P = 1.92 × 10-2), and age at onset (SERPINB1: β = 0.043, P = 4.62 × 10-3).

METHODS AND FINDINGS: ""Residual cognition"" was quantified by regressing out the effects of cerebral pathologies and demographic characteristics on global cognitive performance proximate to death. To identify genes influencing residual cognition, we leveraged neuropathological, genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptional data available for deceased participants of the Religious Orders Study (n = 492) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (n = 487). Given that our sample size was underpowered to detect genome-wide significance, we applied a multistep approach to identify genes influencing residual cognition, based on our prior observation that independent genetic and epigenetic risk factors can converge on the same locus. In the first step (n = 979), we performed a genome-wide association study with a predefined suggestive p < 10-5, and nine independent loci met this threshold in eight distinct chromosomal regions. Three of the six genes within 100 kb of the lead SNP are expressed in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC): UNC5C, ENC1, and TMEM106B. In the second step, in the subset of participants with DLPFC DNA methylation data (n = 648), we found that residual cognition was related to differential DNA methylation of UNC5C and ENC1 (false discovery rate < 0.05). In the third step, in the subset of participants with DLPFC RNA sequencing data (n = 469), brain transcription levels of UNC5C and ENC1 were evaluated for their association with residual cognition: RNA levels of both UNC5C (estimated effect = -0.40, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.10, p = 0.0089) and ENC1 (estimated effect = 0.0064, 95% CI 0.0033 to 0.0096, p = 5.7 × 10-5) were associated with residual cognition. In secondary analyses, we explored the mechanism of these associations and found that ENC1 may be related to the previously documented effect of depression on cognitive decline, while UNC5C may alter the composition of presynaptic terminals. Of note, the TMEM106B allele identified in the first step as being associated with better residual cognition is in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs1990622A (r2 = 0.66), a previously identified protective allele for TDP-43 proteinopathy. Limitations include the small sample size for the genetic analysis, which was underpowered to detect genome-wide significance, the evaluation being limited to a single cortical region for epigenetic and transcriptomic data, and the use of categorical measures for certain non-amyloid-plaque, non-neurofibrillary-tangle neuropathologies. CONCLUSIONS: Through a multistep analysis of cognitive, neuropathological, genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic data, we identified ENC1 and UNC5C as genes with convergent genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic evidence supporting a potential role in the dissociation of cognition and neuropathology in an aging population, and we expanded our understanding of the TMEM106B haplotype that is protective against TDP-43 proteinopathy.",2017-04,e1002287,PLoS Med,PubMed,PMID: 28441426 PMCID: PMC5404753,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28441426,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Alleles; Genotype; RNA; Microfilament Proteins; Membrane Proteins; Receptors, Cell Surface; Genome-Wide Association Study; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Aging; Memory; Linkage Disequilibrium; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Nerve Tissue Proteins; TDP-43 Proteinopathies; Cognition Disorders; Depression; Nuclear Proteins; Neuropeptides; Netrin Receptors",

However, the spatial pattern of these alterations and the degree to which they reflect the accumulation of common age-related neuropathologies are unknown. In this study, we characterized the profile of R2 alterations in post-mortem brains of persons with clinical diagnosis of AD dementia and investigated how the profile differs after accounting for neuropathologic indices of AD, cerebral infarcts, Lewy body disease, hippocampal sclerosis and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43. Data came from 567 post-mortem brains donated by participants in two cohort studies of aging and dementia. R2 was quantified using fast spin echo imaging. Voxelwise linear regression examined R2 alterations between subjects diagnosed with AD dementia at death and those with no cognitive impairment. Voxels showing significant R2 alterations were clustered into regions of interest (ROIs). Three R2 profiles were compared, which were adjusted for (1) demographics only; (2) demographics and AD pathology; (3) demographics, AD pathology and other common neuropathologies. R2 alterations were observed throughout the hemisphere, most commonly in white matter. Of the distinct ROIs identified, the largest region encompassed large portions of white matter in all lobes. This ROI became smaller in size but remained largely intact after adjusting for AD and other neuropathologic indices. Further, R2 alterations identify AD dementia with improved accuracy, above and beyond demographics and neuropathologic indices (p<0.0001).

This study investigated the possible association of FADD forms with age-related neuropathologies, cognitive function, and the odds of dementia in an elderly community sample. METHODS: FADD forms were quantified by western blot analysis in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) samples from a large cohort of participants in a community-based aging study (Memory and Aging Project, MAP), experiencing no-(NCI, n = 51) or mild-(MCI, n = 42) cognitive impairment, or dementia (n = 57). RESULTS: Cortical FADD was lower in subjects with dementia and lower FADD was associated with a greater load of amyloid-β pathology, fewer presynaptic terminal markers, poorer cognitive function and increased odds of dementia. Together with the observations of FADD redistribution into tangles and dystrophic neurites within plaques in Alzheimer's disease brains, and its reduction in APP23 mouse cortex, the results suggest this multifunctional protein might participate in the mechanisms linking amyloid and tau pathologies during the course of the illness.

Although genetic studies have identified AD-associated SNPs in APOE and other genes, genetic information has not been integrated into an epidemiological framework for risk prediction. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using genotype data from 17,008 AD cases and 37,154 controls from the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP Stage 1), we identified AD-associated SNPs (at p < 10-5). We then integrated these AD-associated SNPs into a Cox proportional hazard model using genotype data from a subset of 6,409 AD patients and 9,386 older controls from Phase 1 of the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), providing a polygenic hazard score (PHS) for each participant. By combining population-based incidence rates and the genotype-derived PHS for each individual, we derived estimates of instantaneous risk for developing AD, based on genotype and age, and tested replication in multiple independent cohorts (ADGC Phase 2, National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Center [NIA ADC], and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI], total n = 20,680). Within the ADGC Phase 1 cohort, individuals in the highest PHS quartile developed AD at a considerably lower age and had the highest yearly AD incidence rate. Among APOE ε3/3 individuals, the PHS modified expected age of AD onset by more than 10 y between the lowest and highest deciles (hazard ratio 3.34, 95% CI 2.62-4.24, p = 1.0 × 10-22). In independent cohorts, the PHS strongly predicted empirical age of AD onset (ADGC Phase 2, r = 0.90, p = 1.1 × 10-26) and longitudinal progression from normal aging to AD (NIA ADC, Cochran-Armitage trend test, p = 1.5 × 10-10), and was associated with neuropathology (NIA ADC, Braak stage of neurofibrillary tangles, p = 3.9 × 10-6, and Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease score for neuritic plaques, p = 6.8 × 10-6) and in vivo markers of AD neurodegeneration (ADNI, volume loss within the entorhinal cortex, p = 6.3 × 10-6, and hippocampus, p = 7.9 × 10-5). Additional prospective validation of these results in non-US, non-white, and prospective community-based cohorts is necessary before clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: We have developed a PHS for quantifying individual differences in age-specific genetic risk for AD. Within the cohorts studied here, polygenic architecture plays an important role in modifying AD risk beyond APOE.

METHODS: Data were drawn from a large autopsy series (N = 1,337) of individuals followed longitudinally from normal or MCI status to death, derived from 4 Alzheimer Disease (AD) Centers in the United States. RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 7.9 years. Of the 874 individuals ever diagnosed with MCI, final clinical diagnoses were varied: 39.2% died with an MCI diagnosis, 46.8% with a dementia diagnosis, and 13.9% with a diagnosis of intact cognition. The latter group had pathological features resembling those with a final clinical diagnosis of MCI. In terms of non-AD pathologies, both primary age-related tauopathy (p < 0.05) and brain arteriolosclerosis pathology (p < 0.001) were more severe in MCI than cognitively intact controls. Among the group that remained MCI until death, mixed AD neuropathologic changes (ADNC; ≥1 comorbid pathology) were more frequent than ""pure"" ADNC pathology (55% vs 22%); suspected non-Alzheimer pathology comprised the remaining 22% of cases. A majority (74%) of subjects who died with MCI were without ""high""-level ADNC, Lewy body disease, or hippocampal sclerosis pathologies; this group was enriched in cerebrovascular pathologies. Subjects who died with dementia and were without severe neurodegenerative pathologies tended to have cerebrovascular pathology and carry the MCI diagnosis for a longer interval.

Significant emerging evidence has linked cholesterol, β-amyloid and AD, and several studies have shown a reduced risk for AD and dementia in populations treated with statins. However, while some clinical trials evaluating statins in general AD populations have been conducted, these resulted in no significant therapeutic benefit. By focusing on subgroups of the AD population, it may be possible to detect endotypes responsive to statin therapy. METHODS: Here we investigate the possible protective and therapeutic effect of statins in AD through the analysis of datasets of integrated clinical trials, and prospective observational studies. RESULTS: Re-analysis of AD patient-level data from failed clinical trials suggested by trend that use of simvastatin may slow the progression of cognitive decline, and to a greater extent in ApoE4 homozygotes. Evaluation of continual long-term use of various statins, in participants from multiple studies at baseline, revealed better cognitive performance in statin users. These findings were supported in an additional, observational cohort where the incidence of AD was significantly lower in statin users, and ApoE4/ApoE4-genotyped AD patients treated with statins showed better cognitive function over the course of 10-year follow-up.

Linear mixed models compared the rates of decline in cognition among APOE ε3/3 carriers with different '523 genotypes. RESULTS: The 1,170 APOE ε3/3 homozygotes were of European ancestry, were free of dementia at baseline, and had an average age of 78.5 years at baseline.

Prospective cohort studies were included if they reported relative risk (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) of cognitive decline or dementia in relation to walking pace. RESULTS: Seventeen studies were identified, including 10 studies reporting the RR of cognitive decline (9,949 participants and 2,547 events) and 10 presenting the RR of dementia (14,140 participants and 1,903 events).

Structural abnormalities in hippocampal volume and shape are found in several common neuropsychiatric disorders. To identify the genetic underpinnings of hippocampal structure here we perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 33,536 individuals and discover six independent loci significantly associated with hippocampal volume, four of them novel. Of the novel loci, three lie within genes (ASTN2, DPP4 and MAST4) and one is found 200 kb upstream of SHH. A hippocampal subfield analysis shows that a locus within the MSRB3 gene shows evidence of a localized effect along the dentate gyrus, subiculum, CA1 and fissure. Further, we show that genetic variants associated with decreased hippocampal volume are also associated with increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (rg=-0.155).

METHODS: Of 1,058 autopsied participants, 343 (32.4%) did not have pathologic diagnoses of AD or FTLD. Diagnosis of dementia was based on clinical evaluation and cognitive performance tests, which were used to create summary measures of global cognition and of 5 cognitive domains. TDP-43 pathology evaluated in 6 brain regions by immunohistochemistry was converted into a summary measure of TDP-43 severity. RESULTS: Of 343 participants, 135 (39.4%) had TDP-43 pathology with a mean TDP-43 severity score of 0.394 (SD 0.490). TDP-43 inclusions were confined to the amygdala (stage 1) in 43.7% of participants, 40% showed additional involvement of the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex (stages 2), while fewer (16.3%) showed additional TDP-43 pathology in the temporal and frontal cortices (stage 3). Severity of TDP-43 pathology was independently related to lower function in global cognition and episodic and semantic memory while increased odds of dementia was only a trend. When participants with hippocampal sclerosis (HS) were excluded from the models, TDP-43 pathology remained associated with lower episodic memory but relationships with global cognition, semantic memory, and dementia were attenuated. CONCLUSIONS: TDP-43 pathology in elders, without pathologic diagnoses of AD or FTLD, is common and independently associated with lower function in episodic memory, while its associations with global cognitive impairment and dementia are difficult to separate from HS.",14/02/2017,653-660,Neurology,PubMed,PMID: 28087828 PMCID: PMC5317379,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28087828,"Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Brain; Cognition; Dementia; Longitudinal Studies; Neuropsychological Tests; TDP-43 Proteinopathies; Logistic Models; Severity of Illness Index; Immunohistochemistry; Mental Status Schedule; Memory Disorders; Tuberous Sclerosis",

Participants were 1096 deceased persons from two clinical-pathologic studies. All were without dementia at baseline, completed a detailed battery of cognitive tests annually over up to 21 years, died, and underwent detailed neuropathologic examinations to identify Alzheimer's disease pathology, vascular pathologies (i.e. macro- and microscopic infarcts, atherosclerosis, arteriolar sclerosis, and cerebral amyloid angiopathy), Lewy bodies, transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology, and hippocampal sclerosis. A time-varying effects model was used to flexibly characterize the trajectory of global cognition and assess whether the effects of demographics and each neuropathologic index on cognition changed over time. Results indicated that the mean trajectory of global cognition was characterized by gradual cognitive decline beginning ∼15 years before death and accelerated decline in the last few years. With the exception of microinfarcts and arteriolar sclerosis, all neuropathologies were associated with the cognitive trajectory. However, the nature of their associations varied. Alzheimer's disease pathology, macroscopic infarcts, Lewy bodies, TDP-43 pathology, and hippocampal sclerosis were associated with progressive cognitive decline, with their deleterious effects increasing over time. By contrast, atherosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy pathology were associated with a lower level of cognition but their effects were relatively stable over time. These results suggest that age-related neuropathologies are differentially related to late life cognitive trajectories. Whereas some contribute to progressive cognitive deterioration, others lower the level of cognition but exert relatively stable effects over time.",01/03/2017,804-812,Brain,PubMed,PMID: 28082297 PMCID: PMC5837473,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28082297,"Alzheimer’s; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Brain; Longitudinal Studies; neuropathology; Aging; Neuropathology; Neuropsychological Tests; Cognition Disorders; TDP-43; cognitive ageing; Statistics as Topic; small vessel disease",

The newly discovered 5-hydroxymethylcytosine mediates DNA demethylation, is highly abundant in the brain, and is dynamically regulated by life experiences. However, little is known about its genome-wide patterns and potential role in AD. METHODS: Using a genome-wide capture followed by high-throughput sequencing, we studied the genome-wide distribution of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at specific genomic loci in human AD brain and identified differentially hydroxymethylated regions (DhMRs) associated with AD pathology. RESULTS: We identified 517 DhMRs significantly associated with neuritic plaques and 60 DhMRs associated with neurofibrillary tangles. DNA hydroxymethylation in gene bodies was predominantly positively correlated with cis-acting gene expression. Moreover, genes showing differential hydroxymethylation were significantly enriched in neurobiological processes and clustered in functional gene ontology categories.

Our objective was to systematically assess the contribution of genetic variation to gait speed in older individuals. We conducted a meta-analysis of gait speed GWASs in 31,478 older adults from 17 cohorts of the CHARGE consortium, and validated our results in 2,588 older adults from 4 independent studies. We followed our initial discoveries with network and eQTL analysis of candidate signals in tissues. The meta-analysis resulted in a list of 536 suggestive genome wide significant SNPs in or near 69 genes. Further interrogation with Pathway Analysis placed gait speed as a polygenic complex trait in five major networks. Subsequent eQTL analysis revealed several SNPs significantly associated with the expression of PRSS16, WDSUB1 and PTPRT, which in addition to the meta-analysis and pathway suggested that genetic effects on gait speed may occur through synaptic function and neuronal development pathways.

METHODS: Using data from two separate clinical-pathologic cohort studies of aging and AD, the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and the Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), we compared odds of AD dementia proximate to death among participants with and without a history of cancer. We then examined the relation of history of cancer with measures of AD pathology at autopsy, i.e., paired helical filament tau (PHFtau) neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid-β load. RESULTS: Participants reporting a history of cancer had significantly lower odds of AD (OR 0.70 [0.55-0.89], p = 0.0040) proximate to death as compared to participants reporting no prior history of cancer. The results remained significant after adjusting for multiple risk factors including age, sex, race, education, and presence of an APOEɛ4 allele. At autopsy, participants with a history of cancer had significantly fewer PHFtau tangles (p < 0.001) than participants without a history of cancer, but similar levels of amyloid-β.

We aimed to identify genetic polymorphisms significantly associated with a broad phenotype from depressive symptoms to major depressive disorder. METHODS: We analyzed two prior studies of 70,017 participants of European ancestry from general and clinical populations in the discovery stage. We performed a replication meta-analysis of 28,328 participants. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability and genetic correlations were calculated using linkage disequilibrium score regression. Discovery and replication analyses were performed using a p-value-based meta-analysis. Lifetime major depressive disorder and depressive symptom scores were used as the outcome measures. RESULTS: The SNP-based heritability of major depressive disorder was 0.21 (SE = 0.02), the SNP-based heritability of depressive symptoms was 0.04 (SE = 0.01), and their genetic correlation was 1.001 (SE = 0.2). We found one genome-wide significant locus related to the broad depression phenotype (rs9825823, chromosome 3: 61,082,153, p = 8.2 × 10-9) located in an intron of the FHIT gene. We replicated this SNP in independent samples (p = .02) and the overall meta-analysis of the discovery and replication cohorts (1.0 × 10-9). CONCLUSIONS: This large study identified a new locus for depression. Our results support a continuum between depressive symptoms and major depressive disorder. A phenotypically more inclusive approach may help to achieve the large sample sizes needed to detect susceptibility loci for depression.",01/09/2017,322-329,Biol Psychiatry,PubMed,PMID: 28049566 PMCID: PMC5462867,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28049566,Humans; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Phenotype; Genome-wide association study; Depression; White People; Genetic Loci; Neoplasm Proteins; Depressive Disorder; Acid Anhydride Hydrolases; CHARGE consortium; Depressive symptoms; FHIT gene; Major depressive disorder; Psychiatric Genomics Consortium,

Here, we combine multiple large genome-wide association study (GWAS) data sets, from the CHARGE cognitive consortium (n=53 949) and UK Biobank (n=36 035), to partition the genome into 52 functional annotations and an additional 10 annotations describing tissue-specific histone marks. Using stratified linkage disequilibrium score regression we show that, in two measures of cognitive function, SNPs associated with cognitive function cluster in regions of the genome that are under evolutionary negative selective pressure. These conserved regions contained ~2.6% of the SNPs from each GWAS but accounted for ~40% of the SNP-based heritability.

Differences in cognitive reserve may contribute to individual differences in cognitive function in the presence of comparable neuropathology. The protective effects of cognitive reserve could contribute differentially in early versus late stages of the disease. We investigated presynaptic proteins as measures of brain reserve (a subset of total cognitive reserve), and used Braak staging to estimate the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Antemortem evaluations of cognitive function, postmortem assessments of pathologic indices, and presynaptic protein analyses, including the complexins I and II as respective measures of inhibitory and excitatory terminal function, were assayed in multiple key brain regions in 418 deceased participants from a community study. After covarying for demographic variables, pathologic indices, and overall synapse density, lower brain complexin-I and -II levels contributed to cognitive dysfunction (P < 0.01). Each complexin appeared to be dysregulated at a different Braak stage. Inhibitory complexin-I explained 14.4% of the variance in global cognition in Braak 0-II, while excitatory complexin-II explained 7.3% of the variance in Braak V-VI. Unlike other presynaptic proteins, complexins did not colocalize with pathologic tau within neuritic plaques, suggesting that these functional components of the synaptic machinery are cleared early from dystrophic neurites. Moreover, complexin levels showed distinct patterns of change related to memory challenges in a rat model, supporting the functional specificity of these proteins.

METHODS: We used data from 2,617 older persons without dementia. Assessment included baseline self-report UI and annual structured exam which assessed parkinsonian signs, motor performances, cognitive function, and self-report disabilities. We used a series of Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association of UI with parkinsonism and adverse health outcomes and a mixed-effect model to examine the association of UI with the annual rate of cognitive decline. In decedents, regression models were used to examine if UI proximate to death was related to postmortem indices of neuropathologies. RESULTS: At baseline, more than 45% of participants reported some degree of UI. Over an average of nearly 8 years of follow-up, UI was associated with incident parkinsonism (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.12), death (HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.03, 1.11), incident ADL disability (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.07, 1.16), and incident mobility disability (HR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.02, 1.13).

To explore the role of mixed Alzheimer's disease and TDP-43 pathologies in clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia, we performed a comprehensive investigation of TDP-43, mixed pathologies, and clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia in a large cohort of community-dwelling older subjects. We tested the hypotheses that TDP-43 with Alzheimer's disease pathology is a common mixed pathology; is related to increased likelihood of expressing clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia; and that TDP-43 pathologic stage is an important determinant of clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia. Data came from 946 older adults with ( n = 398) and without dementia ( n = 548) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study. TDP-43 proteinopathy (cytoplasmic inclusions) was present in 496 (52%) subjects, and the pattern of deposition was classified as stage 0 (none; 48%), stage 1 (amygdala; 18%), stage 2 (extension to hippocampus/entorhinal; 21%), or stage 3 (extension to neocortex; 14%). TDP-43 pathology combined with a pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was a common mixed pathology (37% of all participants), and the proportion of subjects with clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia formerly labelled 'pure pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease' was halved when TDP-43 was considered. In logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and education, TDP-43 pathology was associated with clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia (odds ratio = 1.51, 95% confidence interval = 1.11, 2.05) independent of pathological Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio = 4.30, 95% confidence interval = 3.08, 6.01) or other pathologies (infarcts, arteriolosclerosis, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis). Mixed Alzheimer's disease and TDP-43 pathologies were associated with higher odds of clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia (odds ratio = 6.73, 95% confidence interval = 4.18, 10.85) than pathologic Alzheimer's disease alone (odds ratio = 4.62, 95% confidence interval = 2.84, 7.52). In models examining TDP-43 stage, a dose-response relationship with clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia was observed, and a significant association was observed starting at stage 2, extension beyond the amygdala.

S-adenosylmethionine administration at these early stages abolished this hypomethylation, diminished the amyloid pathology and restored cognitive capabilities. To assess a possible human significance of findings, we examined the methylation at 12 CpGs sites in the bace-1 promoter, using genome-wide DNA methylation data from 740 postmortem human brains.

It is composed of several distinct subtasks; however, the temporal relationship when transitioning between subtasks has not been well-studied. We tested the hypothesis that longer transition durations between the final turn to the sitting subtasks are associated with worse motor and cognitive performance in older adults. METHODS: A total of 1055 participants (80.33 ± 7.57 years, 76.96% female) performed the TUG while wearing a 3-dimensional inertial sensor on their lower back. We employed a series of linear regressions to examine the association of the duration between the turn and sitting subtasks with clinical characteristics including motor and cognitive functions. RESULTS: Participants employed 2 different strategies when they transitioned from turning to sitting. (1) Distinct transition strategy: 816 participants (77.34%) first completed the turn before starting to sit. The average duration between these distinct subtasks (D-interval) was 715 ± 980 ms. (2) Overlapping transition strategy: 239 participants (22.65%) started to sit before completing the turn. The average overlap duration between these tasks (O-interval) was 237 ± 269 ms. Participants who employed the distinct transition strategy were slightly younger than those who employed the overlapping transition strategy (P ≤ .013). Higher D-intervals and O-intervals were associated with worse TUG performance (P ≤ .02), with poorer motor and cognitive function, [ie, worse parkinsonian gait (P ≤ .001), lower level of perceptual speed (P ≤ .03), and with worse mobility disability (P ≤ .001)]. A longer D-interval was associated with worse gait speed and bradykinesia (P ≤ .001), whereas a longer O-interval was associated with increased rigidity (P = .004).

These ""epigenomic"" features are found in a number of different forms: they include DNA methylation, covalent modifications of histone proteins and non-coding RNAs. Some of these features have now been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we focus on recent studies that have identified robust observations relating to DNA methylation and chromatin in human brain tissue; these findings will ground the next generation of studies and provide a model for the design of such studies. Stemming from observations that compounds with histone deacetylase activity may be beneficial in AD, epigenome-wide studies in cortical samples from large numbers of human subjects have now shown that AD-associated epigenomic changes are reproducible, are not driven by genetic risk factors, and are widespread at specific locations in the genome. A fundamental question of whether such changes are causal remains to be demonstrated, but it is already clear that well-powered investigations of the human epigenome in the target organ of a neurodegenerative disease are feasible, are implicating new areas of the genome in the disease, and will be an important tool for future studies.

Meta-analysis of these results showed no significant association between NEO-FFI personality polygenic scores and the wellbeing measures. IRT extraversion and neuroticism polygenic scores were used to predict life satisfaction and positive affect in almost 37,000 individuals from UK Biobank. Significant positive associations (effect sizes <0.05%) were observed between the extraversion polygenic score and wellbeing measures, and a negative association was observed between the polygenic neuroticism score and life satisfaction. Furthermore, using GWA data, genetic correlations of -0.49 and -0.55 were estimated between neuroticism with life satisfaction and positive affect, respectively. The moderate genetic correlation between neuroticism and wellbeing is in line with twin research showing that genetic influences on wellbeing are also shared with other independent personality domains.",2016-10,407-417,Twin Res Hum Genet,PubMed,PMID: 27546527 PMCID: PMC5125297,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27546527,Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; genetics; Genome-Wide Association Study; United Kingdom; Multifactorial Inheritance; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Affect; genetic correlation; happiness; Personal Satisfaction; Personality Development; polygenic prediction; wellbeing,

Investigations have shown that antecedent CV risk factors increase the risk for LOAD, although other investigations have failed to validate this association. OBJECTIVE: To study the contribution of CV risk factors (type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease) and the history of stroke to LOAD in a data set of large families multiply affected by LOAD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The National Institute on Aging Late-Onset Alzheimer Disease/National Cell Repository for Alzheimer Disease family study (hereinafter referred to as NIA-LOAD study) is a longitudinal study of families with multiple members affected with LOAD. A multiethnic community-based longitudinal study (Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project [WHICAP]) was used to replicate findings. The 6553 participants in the NIA-LOAD study were recruited from 23 US Alzheimer disease centers with ongoing data collection since 2003; the 5972 WHICAP participants were recruited at Columbia University with ongoing data collection since 1992. Data analysis was performed from 2003 to 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Generalized mixed logistic regression models tested the association of CV risk factors (primary association) with LOAD. History of stroke was used for the secondary association. A secondary model adjusted for the presence of an apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele. A genetic risk score, based on common variants associated with LOAD, was used to account for LOAD genetic risk beyond the APOE ε4 effect. Mediation analyses evaluated stroke as a mediating factor between the primary association and LOAD. RESULTS: A total of 6553 NIA-LOAD participants were included in the analyses (4044 women [61.7%]; 2509 men [38.3%]; mean [SD] age, 77.0 [9] years), with 5972 individuals from the WHICAP study included in the replication sample (4072 women [68.2%]; 1900 men [31.8%]; mean [SD] age, 76.5 [7.0] years). Hypertension was associated with decreased LOAD risk (odds ratio [OR], 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55-0.72); type 2 diabetes and heart disease were not. History of stroke conferred greater than 2-fold increased risk for LOAD (OR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.75-2.83). Adjustment for APOE ε4 did not alter results. The genetic risk score was associated with LOAD (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.05-3.97) but did not change the independent association of LOAD with hypertension or stroke. In the WHICAP sample, hypertension was not associated with LOAD (OR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88-1.11), whereas history of stroke increased the risk for LOAD (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.56-2.46). The effect of hypertension on LOAD risk was also mediated by stroke in the NIA-LOAD and the WHICAP samples. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In familial and sporadic LOAD, a history of stroke was significantly associated with increased disease risk and mediated the association between selected CV risk factors and LOAD, which appears to be independent of the LOAD-related genetic background.",01/10/2016,1231-1237,JAMA Neurol,PubMed,PMID: 27533593 PMCID: PMC5155512,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27533593,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; United States; Pedigree; Alzheimer Disease; Risk Factors; Longitudinal Studies; Hypertension; Age of Onset; Stroke; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Comorbidity; Heart Diseases",

RESULTS: We analyzed blood, saliva, and brain samples from seven different racial/ethnic groups. We assessed the intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration of blood (independent of blood cell counts) and the extrinsic epigenetic aging rates of blood (dependent on blood cell counts and tracks the age of the immune system). In blood, Hispanics and Tsimane Amerindians have lower intrinsic but higher extrinsic epigenetic aging rates than Caucasians. African-Americans have lower extrinsic epigenetic aging rates than Caucasians and Hispanics but no differences were found for the intrinsic measure.

METHODS: Four parkinsonian signs were assessed with a modified motor portion of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale in 2,001 older adults without parkinsonism. We used Cox proportional hazards models to determine the associations of age and sex with incident parkinsonism (2 or more signs). We calculated the number of events per 1,000 person-years of observation in 3 age strata. Next, we investigated several potential risk factors for incident parkinsonism. Then, we examined longitudinal progression of parkinsonism using discrete-time multistate Markov models. RESULTS: Average age at baseline was 76.8 years (SD 7.62 years). During an average of 5 years of follow-up, 964/2,001 (48.2%) developed parkinsonism. Age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08-1.10) but not male sex (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.91-1.23) was associated with incident parkinsonism. The incidence of parkinsonism per 1,000 person-years of follow-up was 36.0 for adults <75 years of age, 94.8 for those 75-84, and 160.5 for those 85 years or older. Depressive symptoms, neuroticism, urinary incontinence, sleep complaints, and chronic health conditions were associated with incident parkinsonism. Secondary analyses suggest that risk factors are linked with incident parkinsonism via early motor signs of parkinsonism and cognitive function. Transition modeling suggests that while parkinsonism may fluctuate, it is progressive in most older adults and its risk factors increase the odds of its progression.

Similarly, the transcription cofactors CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 are reduced in the prefrontal cortex of AD patients, indicating additional dysfunction of CREB signaling in AD. Importantly, we show that pCREB expression is reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of AD subjects. In addition, pCREB levels in PBMC positively correlated with pCREB expression in the postmortem brain of persons with AD.

METHODS: We repurposed data in which AD-related myeloid proteins CD33, TREM1, TREM2, TREML2, TYROBP, and PTK2B were measured by flow cytometry in monocytes from 176 participants of the PhenoGenetic Project (PGP) and Harvard Aging Brain Study. Linear regression was used to identify associations between 24 PD risk variants and protein expression. The 2 cohorts were meta-analyzed in a discovery analysis, and the 4 most strongly suggestive results were validated in an independent cohort of 50 PGP participants. RESULTS: We discovered and validated an association between the PD risk allele rs12456492(G) in the RIT2 locus and increased CD33 expression (p joint = 3.50 × 10(-5)) and found strongly suggestive evidence that rs11060180(A) in the CCDC62/HIP1R locus decreased PTK2B expression (p joint = 1.12 × 10(-4)). Furthermore, in older individuals, increased CD33 expression on peripheral monocytes was associated with a greater burden of parkinsonism (p = 0.047), particularly bradykinesia (p = 6.64 × 10(-3)). CONCLUSIONS: We find that the rs12456492 PD risk variant affects expression of AD-associated protein CD33 in peripheral monocytes, which suggests that genetic factors for these 2 diseases may converge to influence overlapping innate immune-mediated mechanisms that contribute to neurodegeneration.

In this study, we investigated the relationship between parkinsonian signs and MAPT transcripts by assessing the effect of MAPT haplotypes on alternative splicing and expression levels of the most common isoforms in two prospective clinicopathologic studies of aging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: using regression analysis, controlling for age, sex, study and neuropathology, we evaluated 976 subjects with clinical, genotyping and brain pathology data for haplotype analysis. For transcript analysis, we obtained MAPT gene and isoform-level expression from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for 505 of these subjects. RESULTS: The MAPT H2 haplotype was associated with lower total MAPT expression (p = 1.2x10-14) and global parkinsonism at both study entry (p = 0.001) and proximate to death (p = 0.050). Specifically, haplotype H2 was primarily associated with bradykinesia in both assessments (p<0.001 and p = 0.008). MAPT total expression was associated with age and decreases linearly with advancing age (p<0.001). Analysing MAPT alternative splicing, the expression of 1N/4R isoform was inversely associated with global parkinsonism (p = 0.008) and bradykinesia (p = 0.008). Diminished 1N/4R isoform expression was also associated with H2 (p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our results suggest that age and H2 are associated with higher parkinsonism score and decreased total MAPT RNA expression. Additionally, we found that H2 and parkinsonism are associated with altered expression levels of specific isoforms.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether TBI with loss of consciousness (LOC) is associated with an increased risk for clinical and neuropathologic findings of Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), and other dementias. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study analyzed data from the Religious Orders Study (ROS), Memory and Aging Project (MAP), and Adult Changes in Thought study (ACT). All ROS and MAP participants and a subset of ACT participants consent to autopsy. Studies performed annual (ROS and MAP) or biennial (ACT) cognitive and clinical testing to identify incident cases of dementia and AD. The 7130 participants included members of a Seattle-area health care delivery system (ACT), priests and nuns living in orders across the United States (ROS), and Chicago-area adults in retirement communities (MAP). Of these, 1589 underwent autopsy. Primary hypothesis was that TBI with LOC would be associated with increased risk for AD and neurofibrillary tangles. Data were accrued from 1994 to April 1, 2014. EXPOSURES: Self-reported TBI when the participant was free of dementia, categorized as no more than 1 vs more than 1 hour of LOC. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical outcomes included incident all-cause dementia, AD, and PD in all studies and incident mild cognitive impairment and progression of parkinsonian signs in ROS and MAP. Neuropathologic outcomes included neurofibrillary tangles, neuritic plaques, microinfarcts, cystic infarcts, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis in all studies. RESULTS: Of 7130 participants (2879 [40.4%] men; overall mean [SD] age, 79.9 [6.9] years), 865 reported a history of TBI with LOC.

METHODS: This is a postmortem study including 1,017 autopsied participants from 2 clinicopathologic cohorts. Analyses focused on 22 genomic variants associated with AD dementia in large-scale case-control genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses. The neuropathologic traits of interest were a pathologic diagnosis of AD according to NIA-Reagan criteria, macroscopic and microscopic infarcts, Lewy bodies (LB), and hippocampal sclerosis. For each variant, multiple logistic regression was used to investigate its association with neuropathologic traits, adjusting for age, sex, and subpopulation structure. We also conducted power analyses to estimate the sample sizes required to detect genome-wide significance (p < 5 × 10(-8)) for pathologic AD for all variants. RESULTS: APOE ε4 allele was associated with greater odds of pathologic AD (odds ratio [OR] 3.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.67-5.46, p = 1.9 × 10(-13)), while ε2 allele was associated with lower odds of pathologic AD (OR 0.42, 95% CI 0.30-0.61, p = 3.1 × 10(-6)).

Genomewide association analysis was conducted on ~2.7 million imputed and genotyped variants (SNPs). Replication of the most significant findings was conducted using data from 6393 individuals from three cohorts. GWAS of lower body strength was also characterized in a subset of cohorts. Two genomewide significant (P-value< 5 × 10(-8) ) and 39 suggestive (P-value< 5 × 10(-5) ) associations were observed from meta-analysis of the discovery cohorts.

This SNP is mapped to an intergenic region and is located within an accessible chromatin region (DNase hypersensitivity site) in skeletal muscle myotubes differentiated from the human skeletal muscle myoblasts cell line. This locus alters a binding motif of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-β (CEBPB) that is implicated in muscle repair mechanisms. GWAS of lower body strength did not yield significant results.

We constructed a genetic risk score (GRS) comprising common genetic variants associated with AD, evaluated its association with incident AD and assessed its capacity to improve risk prediction over traditional models based on age, sex, education, and APOEɛ4. In eight prospective cohorts included in the International Genomics of Alzheimer's Project (IGAP), we derived weighted sum of risk alleles from the 19 top SNPs reported by the IGAP GWAS in participants aged 65 and older without prevalent dementia. Hazard ratios (HR) of incident AD were estimated in Cox models. Improvement in risk prediction was measured by the difference in C-index (Δ-C), the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI>0). Overall, 19,687 participants at risk were included, of whom 2,782 developed AD. The GRS was associated with a 17% increase in AD risk (pooled HR = 1.17; 95% CI =   [1.13-1.21] per standard deviation increase in GRS; p-value =  2.86×10-16).

Neurology,1474-4465,10.1016/S1474-4422(16)30029-1,"BACKGROUND: Few data on the pathology of cerebral vessel disease, dementia, and cognition are available. We examined the association of cerebral atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis neuropathology with probable and possible Alzheimer's disease dementia and cognitive function. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included men and women aged 65 years or older who had yearly clinical assessments and had agreed to brain autopsy at the time of death, as part of one of two cohort studies of ageing (The Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project). Individuals without dementia or with Alzheimer's disease dementia, and with complete neuropathological data, are included in our analyses. We used neuropsychological data proximate to death to create summary measures of global cognition and cognitive domains. Clinical data recorded between 1994 and 2015 were used to determine presence of Alzheimer's disease dementia. Systematic neuropathological assessments documented the severity of cerebral large vessel (atherosclerosis) and small vessel (arteriolosclerosis) disease. By use of regression analyses adjusted for demographics, gross and microscopic infarcts, and Alzheimer's disease pathology, we examined associations of vessel disease severity (mild, moderate, and severe) with odds of probable and possible Alzheimer's disease dementia and cognitive function. FINDINGS: Study enrolment began in January, 1994, and two cohort studies are ongoing. 1143 individuals were included in our analyses (median age at death 88·8 years; 478 [42%] with Alzheimer's disease dementia). Moderate-to-severe atherosclerosis was present in 445 (39%) individuals, and arteriolosclerosis in 401 (35%) individuals. Each level increase in the severity of atherosclerosis or arteriolosclerosis was associated with significantly higher odds of Alzheimer's disease dementia (odds ratio [OR] for atherosclerosis 1·33, 95% CI 1·11-1·58; OR for arteriolosclerosis 1·20, 1·04-1·40). Atherosclerosis was associated with lower scores for global cognition (estimate -0·10 [SE 0·04], p=0·0096) and four cognitive domains (episodic memory -0·10 [0·04], p=0·017; semantic memory -0·11 [0·05], p=0·018; perceptual speed -0·14 [0·04], p=0·00080; and visuospatial abilities -0·13 [0·04], p=0·0080), but not working memory (-0·05 [0·04], p=0·21). Arteriolosclerosis was associated with lower scores for global cognition (estimate -0·10 [0·03], p=0·0015) and four domains (episodic memory -0·12 [0·04], p=0·00090; semantic memory -0·10 [0·04], p=0·013; working memory -0·07 [0·03], p=0·045; perceptual speed -0·12 [0·04], p=0·0012), and a non-significant association was noted for visuospatial abilities (-0·07 [0·03], p=0·052). Findings were unchanged in analyses controlling for the presence of APOE ε4 allele or vascular risk factors. INTERPRETATION: Cerebral atherosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis are associated with Alzheimer's disease dementia, and are also associated with low scores in most cognitive domains. Cerebral vessel pathology might be an under-recognised risk factor for Alzheimer's disease dementia.

Cerebral hemispheres were obtained from 425 deceased older adults who had undergone 2 or more annual cognitive assessments, which included clinical diagnosis of dementia. Specimens underwent MRI to produce maps of transverse relaxation rate, R2. Voxelwise regression revealed brain regions where R2 was associated with cognitive decline. We then used random effects models to quantify the extent to which R2 accounted for variation in decline, after adjustment for demographics and neuropathologic indices of the 3 most common causes of dementia: Alzheimer's disease, cerebrovascular disease, and Lewy body disease. We additionally tested whether R2 was tied to greater likelihood of clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia using logistic regression models. During an average of 8.1 years, the mean rate of decline in global cognitive function was 0.13 unit per year (p < 0.0001). The tissue alteration most commonly related to decline was R2 slowing in white matter. Each unit decrease in R2 was associated with an additional 0.053-unit per year steepening of the rate of global cognitive decline (p < 0.001). Furthermore, R2 accounted for 8.4% of the variance in rate of global cognitive decline, above and beyond the 26.5% accounted for by demographics and neuropathologic indices, and 7.1%-11.2% of the variance of the decline rates in episodic, semantic, and working memory and perceptual speed. Alterations in R2 were also related to an increased odds of clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia (odds ratio = 2.000, 95% confidence interval 1.600, 2.604).

Here, we show that brain nmnat2 mRNA levels correlate positively with global cognitive function and negatively with AD pathology. In AD brains, NMNAT2 mRNA and protein levels are reduced. NMNAT2 shifts its solubility and colocalizes with aggregated Tau in AD brains, similar to chaperones, which aid in the clearance or refolding of misfolded proteins. Investigating the mechanism of this observation, we discover a novel chaperone function of NMNAT2, independent from its enzymatic activity. NMNAT2 complexes with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) to refold aggregated protein substrates. NMNAT2's refoldase activity requires a unique C-terminal ATP site, activated in the presence of HSP90. Furthermore, deleting NMNAT2 function increases the vulnerability of cortical neurons to proteotoxic stress and excitotoxicity. Interestingly, NMNAT2 acts as a chaperone to reduce proteotoxic stress, while its enzymatic activity protects neurons from excitotoxicity. Taken together, our data indicate that NMNAT2 exerts its chaperone or enzymatic function in a context-dependent manner to maintain neuronal health.",2016-06,e1002472,PLoS Biol,PubMed,PMID: 27254664 PMCID: PMC4890852,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27254664,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Animals; Protein Binding; Cells, Cultured; COS Cells; Mutation; Chlorocebus aethiops; Brain; Alzheimer Disease; Cognition; Neurons; Mice, Transgenic; Molecular Chaperones; Blotting, Western; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Nicotinamide-Nucleotide Adenylyltransferase; Protein Folding; Protein Stability; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",

METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and EMBASE through June 2014 to identify peer-reviewed epidemiologic studies of cognitive activity and incidence of AD or all-cause dementia. Eligible articles analyzed data from cohort or nested case-control studies, explicitly defined cognitive activity, evaluated participants for AD or all-cause dementia using clearly defined criteria, and provided effect estimates adjusted for at least age and sex. We describe methodologic issues and biases relevant to interpretation of these studies, and quantify the degree of bias due to confounding and reverse causation required to nullify typically observed associations. RESULTS: We reviewed 12 studies involving 13,939 participants and 1,663 dementia cases, of which 565 were specifically evaluated as AD. Most studies found associations between late-life cognitive activity and lower AD and/or all-cause dementia incidence. Differences in cognitive activity operationalization across studies precluded meta-analysis of effect estimates. Our bias analysis indicated that the observed inverse associations are probably robust to unmeasured confounding, and likely only partially explained by reverse causation.

We used Genome-wide Complex Trait Analysis to (1) estimate phenotypic variance explained by genetics; (2) calculate genetic variance explained by known AD single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); and (3) identify the genomic locations of variation that explain the remaining unexplained genetic variance. In total, 53.24% of phenotypic variance is explained by genetics, but known AD SNPs only explain 30.62% of the genetic variance. Of the unexplained genetic variance, approximately 41% is explained by unknown SNPs in regions adjacent to known AD SNPs, and the remaining unexplained genetic variance outside these regions.",2016-05,200.e13-200.e20,Neurobiol Aging,PubMed,PMID: 27036079 PMCID: PMC4948179,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27036079,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Alzheimer's disease; Genetics; Receptors, Cell Surface; Receptors, Immunologic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Alzheimer Disease; Membrane Glycoproteins; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Genetic Variation; Datasets as Topic; Risk; Genetic variance; Netrin Receptors",

One way to identify people with dysexecutive AD is to consider the difference between memory and executive functioning, which we refer to as the executive prominent/memory prominent spectrum. We aimed to determine if this spectrum was heritable. We used neuropsychological and genetic data from people with mild LOAD (Clinical Dementia Rating 0.5 or 1.0) from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We cocalibrated the neuropsychological data to obtain executive functioning and memory scores and used their difference as a continuous phenotype to calculate its heritability overall and by chromosome. Narrow-sense heritability of the difference between memory and executive functioning scores was 0.68 (standard error 0.12).

Often, however, the trajectory of cognitive function is nonlinear. For example, some participants may experience cognitive decline that accelerates as death approaches. Polynomial regression and piecewise linear models are common approaches used to characterize nonlinear trajectories, although both have assumptions that may not correspond with the actual trajectories. An alternative is to use a flexible sigmoidal mixed model based on the logistic family of curves. We describe a general class of such a model, which has up to five parameters, representing (1) final level, (2) rate of decline, (3) midpoint of decline, (4) initial level before decline, and (5) asymmetry. Focusing on a four-parameter symmetric sub-class of the model, with random effects on two of the parameters, we demonstrate that a likelihood approach to fitting this model produces accurate estimates of mean levels across time, even in the case of model misspecification. We also illustrate the method on deceased participants who had completed at least 5 years of annual cognitive testing and annual assessment of body mass.

METHODS: Participants are 420 older persons from 2 clinical-pathologic studies without cognitive impairment at study onset. They completed a battery of 17 cognitive tests annually for a minimum of 5 years, died, and underwent a neuropathologic examination to quantify neuronal neurofibrillary tangles and transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) pathology and to identify Lewy bodies and hippocampal sclerosis. The authors used sigmoid mixed models based on the 4-parameter logistic distribution to decompose nonlinear global cognitive trajectories into components and assess the relation of each neuropathologic marker to each trajectory component. RESULTS: Cognitive function was assessed for a mean of 10.5 years before death. In the absence of pathology, global cognition was relatively stable before declining moderately in the last 3 to 4 years of life. Tangles were related to all trajectory components except initial level. TDP-43 pathology was the only marker related to initial level of function. It was also associated with an earlier midpoint of decline but not to slope of decline. Hippocampal sclerosis was related to an earlier midpoint of decline and more rapid slope of decline. Lewy bodies were associated with faster slope of decline and lower level of function proximate to death. CONCLUSION: Neurodegenerative processes are differentially related to cognitive trajectories, with TDP-43 pathology most potently impacting incipient cognitive decline, AD pathology and hippocampal sclerosis affecting the progression of cognitive decline, and Lewy bodies impacting terminal decline.

Multivariable-adjusted linear mixed models were used to estimate the association of occupational cognitive requirements score (OCRS) with cognitive function and rate of cognitive decline. RESULTS: Higher OCRS corresponded to significantly better late-life cognitive performance at baseline in 1993 (p < 0.001) and to slower decline in global cognitive function over time (p = 0.004). Within a genotyped subsample (n = 4,104), the associations of OCRS with rate of cognitive decline did not differ significantly by APOE ε4 carriership (p = 0.11).

Attempts to elucidate the genetic basis of MDD may be hindered by heterogeneity in diagnosis. The Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) scale provides a widely used tool for measuring depressive symptoms clustered in four different domains which can be combined together into a total score but also can be analysed as separate symptom domains. METHOD: We performed a meta-analysis of GWAS of the CES-D symptom clusters. We recruited 12 cohorts with the 20- or 10-item CES-D scale (32 528 persons). RESULTS: One single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs713224, located near the brain-expressed melatonin receptor (MTNR1A) gene, was associated with the somatic complaints domain of depression symptoms, with borderline genome-wide significance (p discovery = 3.82 × 10-8). The SNP was analysed in an additional five cohorts comprising the replication sample (6813 persons). However, the association was not consistent among the replication sample (p discovery+replication = 1.10 × 10-6) with evidence of heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the effort to harmonize the phenotypes across cohorts and participants, our study is still underpowered to detect consistent association for depression, even by means of symptom classification. On the contrary, the SNP-based heritability and co-heritability estimation results suggest that a very minor part of the variation could be captured by GWAS, explaining the reason of sparse findings.",2016-06,1613-1623,Psychol Med,PubMed,PMID: 26997408 PMCID: PMC5812462,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26997408,"Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genome-wide association studies; Depression; major depressive disorder; Depressive Disorder, Major; meta-analyses; Receptor, Melatonin, MT1; Somatoform Disorders",

Recently, the largest genome-wide association study in AAs to date confirmed that six of the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related genetic variants originally discovered in EA cohorts are also risk variants in AA; however, the risk attributable to many of the loci (e.g., APOE, ABCA7) differed substantially from previous studies in EA. There likely are risk variants of higher frequency in AAs that have not been discovered. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive analysis of genetically determined local and global ancestry in AAs with regard to LOAD status. RESULTS: Compared to controls, LOAD cases showed higher levels of African ancestry, both globally and at several LOAD relevant loci, which explained risk for AD beyond global differences.

More recently, a growing body of evidence implicates HTN and DM in age-related cognitive decline and risk for dementia, though consensus has yet to be reached on whether older adults living with comorbid HTN and DM are at heightened risk for cognitive impairment. The present study sought to contribute to this topic through a coordinated analysis of 3 longitudinal studies of aging from England, Sweden, and the United States (total N = 12,513). Identical multilevel linear growth models were fit to each to estimate the impact of baseline disease status on initial level and change in verbal declarative memory performance. Overall, few associations between HTN, DM, and cognition were observed. Rate of decline was steeper for Swedish participants with independent HTN but attenuated for their American counterparts. Americans with comorbid HTN and DM showed attenuated decline. Treatment with medication was substantially less prevalent in the earlier-born and lower-educated Swedish sample, which may help to explain our pattern of results. In addition, those living with multiple conditions may be more likely to receive treatment, mitigating cognitive decline. Our results present a nuanced view of the interactions between HTN, DM, and cognition, and lead us to recommend consideration of treatment status or proxies such as birth cohort and education, in combination with age at assessment and specific measure used to interpret research in this area.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether seafood consumption is correlated with increased brain mercury levels and also whether seafood consumption or brain mercury levels are correlated with brain neuropathologies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-sectional analyses of deceased participants in the Memory and Aging Project clinical neuropathological cohort study, 2004-2013. Participants resided in Chicago retirement communities and subsidized housing. The study included 286 autopsied brains of 554 deceased participants (51.6%). The mean (SD) age at death was 89.9 (6.1) years, 67% (193) were women, and the mean (SD) educational attainment was 14.6 (2.7) years. EXPOSURES: Seafood intake was first measured by a food frequency questionnaire at a mean of 4.5 years before death. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Dementia-related pathologies assessed were Alzheimer disease, Lewy bodies, and the number of macroinfarcts and microinfarcts. Dietary consumption of seafood and n-3 fatty acids was annually assessed by a food frequency questionnaire in the years before death. Tissue concentrations of mercury and selenium were measured using instrumental neutron activation analyses. RESULTS: Among the 286 autopsied brains of 544 participants, brain mercury levels were positively correlated with the number of seafood meals consumed per week (ρ = 0.16; P = .02). In models adjusted for age, sex, education, and total energy intake, seafood consumption (≥ 1 meal[s]/week) was significantly correlated with less Alzheimer disease pathology including lower density of neuritic plaques (β = -0.69 score units [95% CI, -1.34 to -0.04]), less severe and widespread neurofibrillary tangles (β = -0.77 score units [95% CI, -1.52 to -0.02]), and lower neuropathologically defined Alzheimer disease (β = -0.53 score units [95% CI, -0.96 to -0.10]) but only among apolipoprotein E (APOE ε4) carriers.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of age at menopause and the duration of the reproductive period with the risk for depression among postmenopausal women with naturally occurring menopause. DATA SOURCES: A search strategy for use of MEDLINE was developed (through January 1, 2015) using the key terms menopause, climacteric, reproductive period, depression, and mood disorders. References of included studies and reviews were also screened; authors were contacted to maximize synthesized evidence. STUDY SELECTION: A total of 12,323 articles, without language restriction, were screened by pairs of reviewers to identify observational studies related to the study hypothesis; 14 studies were eligible for meta-analysis. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Pairs of reviewers independently extracted information on study design and type of analysis by participants' characteristics and methods of depression ascertainment. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and fixed- or random-effects models were implemented. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Pooled-effect estimates for depression, defined by psychiatric evaluation or validated instruments, by age at menopause and duration of the reproductive period. RESULTS: The 14 studies included in the meta-analysis represented 67,714 women. An inverse association (reported as odds ratio [OR]; 95% CI of 2-year increments) with depression in postmenopausal women was shown for increasing age at menopause (0.98; 0.96-0.99 [67,434 unique participants; 13 studies]) and duration of the reproductive period (0.98; 0.96-0.99 [54,715 unique participants; 5 studies]). Menopause at age 40 or more years compared with premature menopause was associated with a 50% decreased risk for depression (3033 unique participants; 4 studies). Pooling of studies examining severe depression showed a 5% decrease in risk of severe depression with increasing (2-year increment) age at menopause (52,736 unique participants; 3 studies); sensitivity analysis of studies controlling for past depression revealed similar results for age at menopause (0.98; 0.96-1.00 [48,894 unique participants; 3 studies). No heterogeneity or publication bias was evident in the main analyses. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Longer exposure to endogenous estrogens, expressed as older age at menopause and longer reproductive period, is associated with a lower risk of depression in later life.

METHODS: Five hundred thirty-five older participants underwent annual cognitive assessments and brain autopsy at death. BDNF gene expression was measured in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Linear mixed models were used to examine whether BDNF expression was associated with cognitive decline adjusting for age, sex, and education. An interaction term was added to determine whether this association varied with clinical diagnosis proximate to death (no cognitive impairment, mild cognitive impairment, or dementia). Finally, we examined the extent to which the association of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology with cognitive decline varied by BDNF expression. RESULTS: Higher brain BDNF expression was associated with slower cognitive decline (p < 0.001); cognitive decline was about 50% slower with the 90th percentile BDNF expression vs 10th. This association was strongest in individuals with dementia. The level of BDNF expression was lower in individuals with pathologic AD (p = 0.006), but was not associated with macroscopic infarcts, Lewy body disease, or hippocampal sclerosis. BDNF expression remained associated with cognitive decline in a model adjusting for age, sex, education, and neuropathologies (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the effect of AD pathology on cognitive decline varied by BDNF expression such that the effect was strongest for high levels of AD pathology (p = 0.015); thus, in individuals with high AD pathology (90th percentile), cognitive decline was about 40% slower with the 90th percentile BDNF expression vs 10th.

We tested the hypothesis that greater sleep fragmentation is associated with a higher burden of cerebral vessel and infarct pathology at autopsy.

RESULTS: Greater sleep fragmentation was associated with more severe arteriolosclerosis (odds ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.59; P=0.03 per 1 SD greater sleep fragmentation) and more subcortical macroscopic infarcts (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.68; P=0.04).

The univariate likelihood of cause-specific data enables separate estimation of cumulative incidence function for each competing risk, in contrast with the multivariate likelihood of full data which estimates cumulative incidence functions for multiple competing risks jointly. Under both likelihoods and certain regularity conditions, we show that the regression parameter estimator is asymptotically normal and semiparametrically efficient, although the spline-based sieve estimator of the baseline cumulative subdistribution hazard converges at a rate slower than root-n.

Recently, we developed a highly accurate epigenetic biomarker of tissue age (known as epigenetic clock) which is based on DNA methylation levels. Here we use n=700 dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) samples from Caucasian subjects of the Religious Order Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project to examine the association between epigenetic age and Alzheimer's disease (AD) related cognitive decline, and AD related neuropathological markers. Epigenetic age acceleration of DLPFC is correlated with several neuropathological measurements including diffuse plaques (r=0.12, p=0.0015), neuritic plaques (r=0.11, p=0.0036), and amyloid load (r=0.091, p=0.016). Further, it is associated with a decline in global cognitive functioning (β=-0.500, p=0.009), episodic memory (β=-0.411, p=0.009) and working memory (β=-0.405, p=0.011) among individuals with AD. The neuropathological markers may mediate the association between epigenetic age and cognitive decline. Genetic complex trait analysis (GCTA) revealed that epigenetic age acceleration is heritable (h2=0.41) and has significant genetic correlations with diffuse plaques (r=0.24, p=0.010) and possibly working memory (r=-0.35, p=0.065).

The presynaptic protein Munc18-1, alternatively spliced into long (M18L) or short (M18S) isoforms, is a critical modulator of neurotransmission. While subtle alterations in Munc18-1 have been shown to cause severe neuropsychiatric disorders with cognitive impairment, little information is known regarding the specific roles of Munc18-1 splice variants. We first investigated functional and anatomical features evidencing the divergent roles of M18L and M18S, and then evaluated their contribution to the full range of age-related cognitive impairment in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of a large sample of participants from a community-based aging study, including subjects with no-(NCI, n = 90), or mild-(MCI, n = 86) cognitive impairment, or with clinical dementia (n = 132). Finally, we used APP23 mutant mice to study the association between M18L/S and the time-dependent accumulation of common Alzheimer's disease pathology. RESULTS: Using isoform-specific antibodies, M18L was localized to the synaptosomal fraction, with a distribution matching lipid raft microdomains. M18S was found widely across cytosolic and synaptosomal compartments. Immunocytochemical studies identified M18L in perisomatic, GABAergic terminals, while M18S was broadly distributed in GABAergic and glutamatergic terminals. Using regression models taking into account multiple age-related pathologies, age, education and sex, global cognitive function was associated with the level of M18L (p = 0.006) but not M18S (p = 0.88). Mean M18L in dementia cases was 51 % lower than in NCI cases (p < 0.001), and each unit of M18L was associated with a lower likelihood of dementia (odds ratio = 0.68, 95 % confidence interval = 0.50-0.90, p = 0.008). In contrast, M18S balanced across clinical and pathologically diagnosed groups. M18L loss may not be caused by age-related amyloid pathology, since APP23 mice (12- and 22-months of age) had unchanged cortical levels of M18L/S compared with wild-type animals. CONCLUSIONS: M18L was localized to presynaptic inhibitory terminals, and was associated with cognitive function and protection from dementia in an elderly, community-based cohort.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTINGS: A community-based study recruited from over 40 residential facilities across the metropolitan Chicago area. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling very old adults (n = 1520; mean age 80.2; standard deviation 7.7). MEASUREMENTS: Eleven motor performances were summarized using a composite motor score. All prescription and over the counter medications taken by participants were inspected and coded using the Medi-Span Data Base System. Demographic characteristics and medical history were obtained by means of detailed interview and medical examinations. RESULTS: In multiple linear regression models, antihypertensive medications were associated with global motor score [β = -0.075, standard error (SE) 0.011, P < .001]. Thus, motor function in an individual with antihypertensive medication, was on average, about 7.5% lower than an age-, sex-, and education-matched individual without antihypertensive medication. The number of antihypertensive medications, which were being used had an additive effect, such that a reduction in the level of motor function was observed with each additional medication, and receiving 3 or more antihypertensive medications was associated with about a 15% reduction in the level of motor function. The association between antihypertensive medications and motor function was robust, and remained unchanged after adjusting for confounding by indication using several potentially confounding variables: smoking, hypertension, diabetes, stroke, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and intermittent claudication (β = -0.05, SE 0.015, P = .001).

One possible explanation for their poorer performance is that the tests used to assess cognition may not reflect the same construct in African Americans and Whites. Therefore, we tested measurement invariance, by race and over time, of a structured 18-test cognitive battery used in three epidemiologic cohort studies of diverse older adults. Multi-group confirmatory factor analyses were carried out with full-information maximum likelihood estimation in all models to capture as much information as was present in the observed data. Four different aspects of the data were fit to each model: comparative fit index (CFI), standardized root mean square residuals (SRMR), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), and model $$\chi ^{2} $$ . We found that the most constrained model fit the data well (CFI=0.950; SRMR=0.051; RMSEA=0.057 (90% confidence interval: 0.056, 0.059); the model $$\chi ^{2} $$ =4600.68 on 862 df), supporting the characterization of this model of cognitive test scores as invariant over time and racial group. These results support the conclusion that the cognitive test battery used in the three studies is invariant across race and time and can be used to assess cognition among African Americans and Whites in longitudinal studies. Furthermore, the lower performance of African Americans on these tests is not due to bias in the tests themselves but rather likely reflect differences in social and environmental experiences over the life course.

We explored whether other members of the (VPS10) domain-containing receptor protein family (the sortilin-related VPS10 domain-containing receptors 2 and 3 (SORCS2 and SORCS3) and sortilin (SORT1)) would have similar effects either independently or together. We conducted the analyses in a large Caucasian case control data set (n=11,840 cases, 10,931 controls) to determine the associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in all the five homologous genes and AD risk. Evidence for interactions between SNPs in the five VPS10 domain receptor family genes was determined in epistatic statistical models. We also compared expression levels of SORCS2, SORCS3 and SORT1 in AD and control brains using microarray gene expression analyses and assessed the effects of these genes on γ-secretase processing of APP. Several SNPs in SORL1, SORCS1, SORCS2 and SORCS3 were associated with AD. In addition, four specific linkage disequilibrium blocks in SORCS1, SORCS2 and SORCS3 showed additive epistatic effects on the risk of AD (P≤0.0006). SORCS3, but not SORCS2 or SORT1, showed reduced expression in AD compared with control brains, but knockdown of all the three genes using short hairpin RNAs in HEK293 cells caused a significant threefold increase in APP processing (from P<0.001 to P<0.05). These findings indicate that in addition to SORL1 and SORCS1, variants in other members of the VPS10 domain receptor family (that is, SORCS1, SORCS2, SORCS3) are associated with AD risk and alter APP processing.

Random change point models were applied to examine the association of the ε4 allele with onset of terminal decline as well as preterminal and terminal slopes. On average, the onset of terminal decline occurred around 3 years before death, and the rate of terminal decline was eightfold faster than the preterminal decline. The presence of the ε4 allele was associated with an earlier onset of terminal decline and faster rates of decline before and after its onset.

However, the standard linear mixed model approach is limited in the face of multidimensional longitudinal data and multiple genotypes. In this setting, the principal components of heritability (PCH) approach may increase efficiency by deriving a linear combination of phenotypes to maximize the heritability attributable to a particular genetic locus. The current study investigated the performance of two PCH methods, the Principal Components of Heritability Association Test (PCHAT) and C2BAT, in detecting association of the known AD susceptibility allele APOE-ϵ4 with cognitive function at baseline and decline in cognition over time. METHODS: PCHAT, C2BAT, and standard linear mixed models were used to test for association between APOE-ϵ4 allele and performance on 19 neuropsychological tests using subjects without dementia at baseline from the Religious Orders Study (ROS) (n = 693) and Memory and Aging Project (MAP) (n = 778). Analyses were conducted across the three methods for three nested phenotype definitions (all 19 measures, executive function and episodic memory measures, and episodic memory only), and for baseline data only versus longitudinal change. RESULTS: In all cases, APOE-ϵ4 was significantly associated with baseline level of and change over time in cognitive function, and PCHAT and C2BAT yielded evidence of association comparable to or stronger than conventional methods.

Identification of disease-associated variants helps identify targets for genetic testing, prevention, and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To identify genetic loci associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease in African Americans. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) assembled multiple data sets representing a total of 5896 African Americans (1968 case participants, 3928 control participants) 60 years or older that were collected between 1989 and 2011 at multiple sites. The association of Alzheimer disease with genotyped and imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was assessed in case-control and in family-based data sets. Results from individual data sets were combined to perform an inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis, first with genome-wide analyses and subsequently with gene-based tests for previously reported loci. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Presence of Alzheimer disease according to standardized criteria. RESULTS: Genome-wide significance in fully adjusted models (sex, age, APOE genotype, population stratification) was observed for a SNP in ABCA7 (rs115550680, allele = G; frequency, 0.09 cases and 0.06 controls; odds ratio [OR], 1.79 [95% CI, 1.47-2.12]; P = 2.2 × 10(-9)), which is in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs previously associated with Alzheimer disease in Europeans (0.8 < D' < 0.9). The effect size for the SNP in ABCA7 was comparable with that of the APOE ϵ4-determining SNP rs429358 (allele = C; frequency, 0.30 cases and 0.18 controls; OR, 2.31 [95% CI, 2.19-2.42]; P = 5.5 × 10(-47)).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this meta-analysis of data from African American participants, Alzheimer disease was significantly associated with variants in ABCA7 and with other genes that have been associated with Alzheimer disease in individuals of European ancestry.

More recently, these successful study designs have been applied to the investigation of intermediate traits that relate to and inform our understanding of clinical syndromes and to exploration of the epigenome, the higher-order structure of DNA that dictates the expression of a given genetic risk factor. While still nascent, given the challenges of accumulating large numbers of subjects with detailed phenotypes and technological hurdles in characterizing the state of chromatin, these efforts represent key investments that will enable the study of the functional consequences of a genetic risk factor and, eventually, its contribution to the clinical manifestations of a given disease.

However, these sex differences have not been examined at the level of the molecular clock and not in human cerebral cortex. The authors tested the hypothesis that there are detectable daily rhythms of clock gene expression in human cerebral cortex and that there are significant sex differences in the timing of these rhythms. The expression levels of 3 clock genes-PER2, PER3, and ARNTL1-were quantified in samples of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from 490 deceased individuals in 2 cohort studies of older individuals, the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, using mRNA microarray data. Clock gene expression at death was parameterized as a function of time of death using cosine curves and was examined for sex differences in the phase of these curves. Significant daily variation was seen in the expression of PER2 (p = 0.004), PER3 (p = 0.003), and ARNTL1 (p = 0.0005).

METHODS: Participants are 165 individuals from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal clinical-pathologic cohort study. They completed a mean of 5.8 years of annual evaluations that included a battery of 19 cognitive tests from which a previously established composite measure of global cognition was derived. Upon death, they had a brain autopsy and uniform neuropathologic examination that provided estimates of the density of aminergic neurons in the locus ceruleus, dorsal raphe nucleus, substantia nigra, and ventral tegmental area plus summary measures of neuronal neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy bodies from these nuclei and medial temporal lobe and neocortex. RESULTS: Neuronal densities in each nucleus were approximately normally distributed. In separate analyses, higher neuronal density in each nucleus except the ventral tegmental area was associated with slower rate of cognitive decline, but when modeled together only locus ceruleus neuronal density was related to cognitive decline (estimate = 0.003, SE = 0.001, p < 0.001). Higher densities of tangles and Lewy bodies in these brainstem nuclei were associated with faster cognitive decline even after controlling for pathologic burden elsewhere in the brain. Locus ceruleus neuronal density, brainstem tangles, and brainstem Lewy bodies had independent associations with rate of cognitive decline. In addition, at higher levels of locus ceruleus neuronal density, the association of Lewy bodies with cognitive decline was diminished.

Some decline rapidly whereas others decline slowly, and there are no known explanations for this variability. We describe the first genome-wide association study to examine rate of cognitive decline in a sample of AD patients with longitudinal measures of cognition. METHODS: The discovery sample was 303 AD cases recruited in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the replication sample was 323 AD cases from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. In the discovery sample, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale responses were tested for association with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using linear regression. We tested the 65 most significant SNPs from the discovery sample for association in the replication sample. RESULTS: We identified SNPs in the spondin 1 gene (SPON1), the minor alleles of which were significantly associated with a slower rate of decline (rs11023139, P = 7.0 × 10(-11)) in the discovery sample. A SPON1 SNP 5.5 kb upstream was associated with decline in the replication sample (rs11606345, P = .002). CONCLUSION: SPON1 has not been previously associated with AD risk, but is plausibly related because the gene product binds to the amyloid precursor protein and inhibits its cleavage by β-secretase.

This endeavor is particularly challenging for neuropsychiatric diseases where diagnoses predominantly rely on the clinical presentation, which may be heterogeneous, possibly due to the heterogeneity of the underlying genetic susceptibility factors and environmental exposures. Although genome-wide association studies of various neuropsychiatric diseases have recently identified susceptibility loci, there likely remain additional genetic risk factors that underlie the liability to these conditions. Furthermore, identification and characterization of the causal risk variant(s) in each of these novel susceptibility loci constitute a formidable task, particularly in the absence of any prior knowledge about their function or mechanism of action. Biologically relevant, quantitative phenotypes, i.e., endophenotypes, provide a powerful alternative to the more traditional, binary disease phenotypes in the discovery and characterization of susceptibility genes for neuropsychiatric conditions. In this review, we focus on Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a model neuropsychiatric disease and provide a synopsis of the recent literature on the use of endophenotypes in AD genetics. We highlight gene expression, neuropathology and cognitive endophenotypes in AD, with examples demonstrating the utility of these alternative approaches in the discovery of novel susceptibility genes and pathways.

The longitudinal behavior of volumes measured ex vivo was assessed. The relationship between in vivo and ex vivo volumetric measurements was investigated in seven elderly subjects imaged both antemortem and postmortem.

Participants are older persons from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Beginning in 2001, they underwent annual clinical evaluations that included detailed cognitive performance testing and a 10-item self-report measure of purpose in life, an aspect of well-being. Initial analyses involved 1,049 individuals who were without dementia at baseline and followed a mean of 5.0 years. The intercepts and slopes of global cognition and purpose were positively correlated, and level of cognition at a given evaluation predicted level of purpose at the subsequent evaluation, consistent with the study hypothesis. Purpose also predicted subsequent cognition. These findings persisted in analyses that excluded mild cognitive impairment or controlled for time varying levels of depressive symptoms or disability. To see whether cognitive decline's correlation with purpose differed from its correlation with other aspects of well-being, we conducted additional analyses on a subgroup of 560 persons without dementia who completed a multidimensional measure of well-being once between 2008 and 2011. More rapid cognitive decline in the period preceding well-being assessment (M = 5.5 years, SD = 2.8) was associated with lower level of nearly all aspects of well-being (5 of 6 measures), but the extent of the association varied across well-being dimensions and was stronger for purpose than for self-acceptance and autonomy.

Alcohol was long thought to be the primary causative agent, but genetic contributions have been of interest since the discovery that rare PRSS1, CFTR and SPINK1 variants were associated with pancreatitis risk. We now report two associations at genome-wide significance identified and replicated at PRSS1-PRSS2 (P < 1 × 10(-12)) and X-linked CLDN2 (P < 1 × 10(-21)) through a two-stage genome-wide study (stage 1: 676 cases and 4,507 controls; stage 2: 910 cases and 4,170 controls). The PRSS1 variant likely affects disease susceptibility by altering expression of the primary trypsinogen gene. The CLDN2 risk allele is associated with atypical localization of claudin-2 in pancreatic acinar cells. The homozygous (or hemizygous in males) CLDN2 genotype confers the greatest risk, and its alleles interact with alcohol consumption to amplify risk.

Collecting objective measures of total daily physical activity in community-dwelling older adults is uncommon, but might enhance the understanding of the relationship of physical activity and disability. We examined whether greater total daily physical activity was associated with less report of disability in the elderly. METHODS: Data were from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal prospective cohort study of common, age-related, chronic conditions. Total daily physical activity was measured in community-dwelling participants with an average age of 82 using actigraphy for approximately 9 days. Disability was measured via self-reported basic activities of daily living (ADL). The odds ratio and 95% Confidence Interval (CI) were determined for the baseline association of total daily physical activity and ADL disability using a logistic regression model adjusted for age, education level, gender and self-report physical activity. In participants without initial report of ADL disability, the hazard ratio and 95% CI were determined for the relationship of baseline total daily physical activity and the development of ADL disability using a discrete time Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for demographics and self-report physical activity. RESULTS: In 870 participants, the mean total daily physical activity was 2. 9 × 105 counts/day (range in 105 counts/day = 0.16, 13. 6) and the mean hours/week of self-reported physical activity was 3.2 (SD = 3.6). At baseline, 718 (82.5%) participants reported being independent in all ADLs. At baseline, total daily physical activity was protective against disability (OR per 105 counts/day difference = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.47, 0.65). Of the participants without baseline disability, 584 were followed for 3.4 years on average. Each 105 counts/day additional total daily physical activity was associated with reduced hazard of developing disability by 25% (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.66, 0.84).

We sought to determine whether GBA influences risk of dementia with LBDNCs, Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathologic changes (ADNCs), or both. METHODS: We screened the entire GBA coding region for mutations in controls and in subjects with dementia and LBDNCs and no or low levels of ADNCs (pure dementia with Lewy bodies [pDLB]), LBDNCs and high-level ADNCs (LBD-AD), and high-level ADNCs but without LBDNCs (AD). RESULTS: Among white subjects, pathogenic GBA mutations were identified in 6 of 79 pDLB cases (7.6%), 8 of 222 LBD-AD cases (3.6%), 2 of 243 AD cases (0.8%), and 3 of 381 controls (0.8%). Subjects with pDLB and LBD-AD were more likely to carry mutations than controls (pDLB: odds ratio [OR] = 7.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.8-31.9; p = 0.006; LBD-AD: OR = 4.6; CI = 1.2-17.6; p = 0.025), but there was no significant difference in frequencies between the AD and control groups (OR = 1.1; CI = 0.2-6.6; p = 0.92). There was a highly significant trend test across groups (χ(2)(1) = 19.3; p = 1.1 × 10(-5)), with the likelihood of carrying a GBA mutation increasing in the following direction: control/AD < LBD-AD < pDLB. CONCLUSIONS: GBA is a susceptibility gene across the LBD spectrum, but not in AD, and appears to convey a higher risk for PD and pDLB than for LBD-AD.

There is little known regarding the independent role of Lewy body pathology in cognition impairment, decline and fluctuations in community-dwelling older persons. We examined the contribution of Lewy body pathology to dementia, global cognition, cognitive domains, cognitive decline and fluctuations in 872 autopsied subjects (mean age = 87.9 years) from the Rush Religious Order Study (n = 491) and Memory and Aging Project (n = 381) longitudinal community-based clinical-pathological studies. Dementia was based on a clinical evaluation; annual cognitive performance tests were used to create a measure of global cognition and five cognitive domains. Lewy body type was determined by using α-synuclein immunostained sections of substantia nigra, limbic and neocortical regions. Statistical models included multiple regression models for dementia and cognition and mixed effects models for decline. Cognitive fluctuations were estimated by comparing standard deviations of individual residuals from mean trajectories of decline in those with and without Lewy bodies. All models controlled for age, sex, education, Alzheimer's disease pathology and infarcts. One hundred and fifty-seven subjects (18%) exhibited Lewy body pathology (76 neocortical-type, 54 limbic-type and 27 nigra-predominant). One hundred and three (66%) subjects with Lewy body pathology had a pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Neocortical-type, but not nigral-predominant or limbic-type Lewy body pathology was related to an increased odds of dementia (odds ratio = 3.21; 95% confidence interval = 1.78-5.81) and lower cognition (P < 0.001) including episodic memory function (P < 0.001) proximate to death. Neocortical-type Lewy body pathology was also related to a faster decline in global cognition (P < 0.001), decline in all five specific cognitive domains (all P-values < 0.001), and to fluctuations in decline of working and semantic memory (P-values < 0.001). Limbic-type Lewy body pathology was related to lower and faster decline in visuospatial skills (P = 0.042). The relationship of Lewy body pathology to cognition and dementia was not modified by Alzheimer's disease pathology. Neocortical-type Lewy body pathology is associated with increased odds of dementia; lower and more rapid decline in all cognitive domains including episodic memory and fluctuations in decline in semantic and working memory. Limbic-type Lewy body pathology is specifically associated with lower and more rapid decline in visuospatial skills.

Cognition was measured using a detailed battery including 19 tests. The association between cognition and temporal discounting was examined via mixed models adjusted for age, sex, education, income, and the number of chronic medical conditions. RESULTS: Descriptive data revealed a consistent pattern whereby older persons with lower cognitive function were more likely to discount greater but delayed rewards compared to those with higher cognitive function. Further, in a mixed effect model adjusted for age, sex, education, income, and chronic medical conditions, global cognitive function was negatively associated with temporal discounting (estimate = -0.45, SE = 0.18, p = 0.015), such that a person with lower cognition exhibited greater discounting.

We tested whether actigraphy could be used to examine the relationship between total daily physical activity and motor function in community-dwelling older persons both with (n = 70) and without (n = 624) clinical dementia. Total daily activity was measured using actigraphy for a median of 9 (range: 2-16) days. All participants also underwent a structured examination, including 9 muscle strength and 9 motor performance measures summarized as a composite measure. In linear regression models controlling for age, sex, and education, total daily activity was associated with global motor scores (β = 0.13, SD = 0.01, P < 0.001). This association remained significant after adjusting for body composition, cognition, depressive symptoms, disability, vascular risk factors, and diseases (β = 0.07, SD = 0.01, P < 0.001). The association did not vary by dementia status (interaction P = 0.53). In persons without dementia, the association was independent of self-reported physical activity. Total daily activity was associated with both muscle strength (β = 0.10, SD = 0.02, P < 0.001) and motor performance (β = 0.16, SD = 0.02, P < 0.001).

We selected 226 persons from 2 longitudinal clinical-pathological studies who were cognitively healthy at baseline, followed at least 4 years (M = 10.2, SD = 3.5), and clinically diagnosed with AD at some point during follow-up. Each evaluation included a battery of 17 cognitive tests from which a previously established composite measure of global cognition was derived. In those who died, a uniform neuropathologic examination established the pathological diagnoses of Alzheimer's disease and other common conditions that impair cognition. Mixed-effects models with 2 change points were used to assess trajectories of cognitive decline. In the main analysis, there was no change in cognitive function until a mean of 7.5 years before dementia was diagnosed (95% confidence interval [CI]: -8.3, -6.7). The global cognitive measure declined a mean of 0.087-unit per year (95% CI: -0.099, -0.073) until a mean of 2.0 years before the diagnosis (95% CI: -2.2, -1.7) when it increased more than 4-fold to a mean loss of 0.370-unit per year (95% CI: -0.417, -0.334). Of 126 individuals who died and underwent autopsy, 101 (80%) met pathologic criteria for AD, of whom 67 had at least one other pathologic condition.

Rare mutations in homologs of evolutionarily conserved clock genes are found in select pedigrees with extreme sleep timing, and there is suggestive evidence that certain common polymorphisms may be associated with self-reported day/night preference. However, no common polymorphism has been associated with the timing of directly observed human behavioral rhythms or other physiological markers of circadian timing at the population level. METHODS: We performed a candidate gene association study with replication, evaluating associations between polymorphisms in homologs of evolutionarily conserved clock genes and the timing of behavioral rhythms measured by actigraphy. For validated polymorphisms, we evaluated associations with transcript expression and time of death in additional cohorts. RESULTS: rs7221412, a common polymorphism near period homolog 1 (PER1), was associated with the timing of activity rhythms in both the discovery and replication cohorts (joint p = 2.1 × 10(-7) ). Mean activity timing was delayed by 67 minutes in rs7221412(GG) versus rs7221412(AA) homozygotes. rs7221412 also showed a suggestive time-dependent relationship with both cerebral cortex (p = 0.05) and CD14+ CD16- monocyte (p = 0.02) PER1 expression and an interesting association with time of death (p = 0.015) in which rs7221412(GG) individuals had a mean time of death nearly 7 hours later than rs7221412(AA/AG) . INTERPRETATION: A common polymorphism near PER1 is associated with the timing of human behavioral rhythms, and shows evidence of association with time of death.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between lower hemoglobin levels and common, age-related neuropathologies associated with cognitive decline. Hemoglobin and neuropathology measures were available in 113 deceased, community-dwelling, older adults participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a prospective, observational, clinical pathology study of aging. The mean hemoglobin level was 13.0 g/dL (SD = 1.4) and was measured 3.2 (SD = 1.3) years prior to death. Thirty-five participants had at least one chronic macroscopic infarction and twenty-nine had at least one chronic microscopic infarction. Eleven participants had Lewy Bodies. The mean Alzheimer's disease pathology score based on a summary measure of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles was 0.56 unit (SD = 0.56; range = 0, 2.34). Using logistic regression models adjusted for age at death, gender, and education, each g/dL lower hemoglobin level increased the odds for having a chronic macroscopic infarction by 37% (95% CI = 1.01, 1.86) but not for having a chronic microscopic infarction (OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 0.82, 1.52) or Lewy Bodies (OR = 1.07; 95% CI = 0.68, 1.68). In an adjusted multiple regression model, hemoglobin level was not associated with the global AD pathology measure (parameter estimate = -0.02, SE = 0.03, p = 0.6). In secondary analyses, lower hemoglobin levels were associated with higher odds of having a chronic macroscopic infarction in a subcortical region but not with higher total subcortical chronic macroscopic infarction volume.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of health and financial literacy with decision making in older adults. METHOD: Data came from 525 community-dwelling older persons without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal study of aging. Health and financial literacy were assessed via a series of questions designed to measure comprehension of health and financial information and concepts. The two scores were averaged to yield a total literacy score. A modified, 12-item version of the Decision-Making Competence Assessment Tool was used to measure financial and healthcare decision making (6 items each), using materials designed to approximate those used in real world settings. All 12 items were summed to yield a total decision-making score. Associations were tested via linear regression models adjusted for age, sex and education. Secondary models adjusted for global cognitive function, income, depression and chronic medical conditions. RESULTS: On average, participants correctly answered 67% of the literacy questions (health literacy = 61.6%, SD = 18.8% and financial literacy = 72.5%, SD = 16.0%). After adjustment for cognitive function, the total literacy score was positively associated with the decision-making total score (estimate = 0.64, SE = 0.08, p < 0.001), as well as healthcare (estimate = 0.37, SE = 0.5, p < 0.001) and financial decision making (estimate = 0.28, SE = 0.05, p < 0.001). Further, total literacy, health and financial literacy all were independently associated with decision making in models adjusted for covariates including income, depression, and chronic medical conditions (all p values < 0.001). Finally, there was evidence of effect modification such that the beneficial association between literacy and healthcare decision making was stronger among older persons, poorer persons and persons at the lower ranges of cognitive ability. CONCLUSION: Among community based older persons without dementia, higher levels of health and financial literacy were associated with better decision making, suggesting that improvements in literacy could facilitate better decision making and lead to better health and quality of life in later years.",2012,531-539,Gerontology,PubMed,PMID: 22739454 PMCID: PMC3491105,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22739454,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Aging; Quality of Life; Health Literacy; Decision Making; Economics; Information Literacy",

OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that purpose in life reduces the deleterious effects of AD pathologic changes on cognition in advanced age. DESIGN: A longitudinal, epidemiologic, clinicopathologic study of aging was conducted that included detailed annual clinical evaluations and brain autopsy. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred forty-six community-based older persons from the Rush Memory and Aging Project participated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Purpose in life was assessed via structured interview, and cognitive function was evaluated annually and proximate to death. On postmortem examination, 3 indexes of AD pathologic features were quantified: global AD pathologic changes, amyloid, and tangles. The associations of disease pathologic changes and purpose in life with cognition were examined using linear regression and mixed models. RESULTS: Purpose in life modified the association between the global measure of AD pathologic changes and cognition (mean [SE] parameter estimate, 0.532 [0.211]; P = .01), such that participants who reported higher levels of purpose in life exhibited better cognitive function despite the burden of the disease. Purpose in life also reduced the association of tangles with cognition (parameter estimate, 0.042 [0.019]; P = .03), and the protective effect of purpose in life persisted even after controlling for several potentially confounding variables. Furthermore, in analyses examining whether purpose in life modified the association between AD pathologic effects and the rate of cognitive decline, we found that higher levels of purpose in life reduced the effect of AD pathologic changes on cognitive decline (parameter estimate, 0.085 [0.039]; P = .03).

Our study focuses on health and financial literacy, two domains of literacy which previous research has suggested may be significantly related to health and wellbeing. Our study examines the relation of health and financial literacy with health promoting behaviors and health status among community-based older persons. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a community-based cohort study of aging in northeastern Illinois. The study consisted of 556 older persons without dementia, each determined by a clinical evaluation. Health and financial literacy were measured using a series of questions designed to assess the ability to understand and process health and financial information, concepts, and numeracy; the two scores were averaged to yield a total literacy score. Health promoting behaviors, including engagement in cognitive, physical, and social activities, were assessed using self report measures. Indicators of heath status, including cognition (global cognition and five specific cognitive abilities), functional status (basic and instrumental activities of daily living, mobility disability), and mental health (depressive symptoms, loneliness) were assessed. RESULTS: In a series of regression models adjusted for age, sex, and education, higher total literacy scores were associated with more frequent participation in health promoting behaviors, including cognitive, physical and social activities (all p values <0.05). Higher total literacy scores were associated with higher cognitive function, less disability, and better mental health (all p values < 0.05). Literacy remained associated with health promoting behaviors and health status in fully adjusted models that also controlled for income and the number of chronic medical conditions. Most of the findings were similar for health and financial literacy except that health literacy was more strongly associated with health promoting behaviors whereas financial literacy was more strongly associated with mental health.

Rare mutations in homologs of evolutionarily conserved clock genes are found in select pedigrees with extreme sleep timing, and there is suggestive evidence that certain common polymorphisms may be associated with self-reported day/night preference. However, no common polymorphism has been associated with the timing of directly observed human behavioral rhythms or other physiological markers of circadian timing at the population level. METHODS: We performed a candidate gene association study with replication, evaluating associations between polymorphisms in homologs of evolutionarily conserved clock genes and the timing of behavioral rhythms measured by actigraphy. For validated polymorphisms, we evaluated associations with transcript expression and time of death in additional cohorts. RESULTS: rs7221412, a common polymorphism near period homolog 1 (PER1), was associated with the timing of activity rhythms in both the discovery and replication cohorts (joint p = 2.1 × 10(-7) ). Mean activity timing was delayed by 67 minutes in rs7221412(GG) versus rs7221412(AA) homozygotes. rs7221412 also showed a suggestive time-dependent relationship with both cerebral cortex (p = 0.05) and CD14+ CD16- monocyte (p = 0.02) PER1 expression and an interesting association with time of death (p = 0.015) in which rs7221412(GG) individuals had a mean time of death nearly 7 hours later than rs7221412(AA/AG) . INTERPRETATION: A common polymorphism near PER1 is associated with the timing of human behavioral rhythms, and shows evidence of association with time of death. This may be mediated by differential PER1 expression.

To understand the functional consequences and potential interactions of the associated loci, we explored large-scale data sets interrogating the human genome for evidence of positive natural selection. Our findings provide significant evidence for signatures of recent positive selection acting on several haplotypes carrying AD susceptibility alleles; interestingly, the genes found in these selected haplotypes can be assembled, independently, into a molecular complex via a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network approach. These results suggest a possible coevolution of genes encoding physically-interacting proteins that underlie AD susceptibility and are coexpressed in different tissues. In particular, PICALM, BIN1, CD2AP, and EPHA1 are interconnected through multiple interacting proteins and appear to have coordinated evidence of selection in the same human population, suggesting that they may be involved in the execution of a shared molecular function. This observation may be AD-specific, as the 12 loci associated with Parkinson disease do not demonstrate excess evidence of natural selection.

In a cohort of 407 older African Americans without dementia (mean age = 72.9; SD = 6.4), we found that a higher level of perceived discrimination was related to poorer cognitive test performance, particularly episodic memory (estimate = -0.03; SE = .013; p < .05) and perceptual speed tests (estimate = -0.04; SE = .015; p < .05).

We implemented a functional fine-mapping approach, leveraging intermediate phenotypes to identify functional variant(s) within the CR1 locus. Using 1709 subjects (697 deceased) from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, we tested 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the linkage disequilibrium block containing the published CR1 AD SNP (rs6656401) for associations with episodic memory decline, and then examined the functional consequences of the top result. We report that a coding variant in the LHR-D (long homologous repeat D) region of the CR1 gene, rs4844609 (Ser1610Thr, minor allele frequency = 0.02), is associated with episodic memory decline and accounts for the known effect of the index SNP rs6656401 (D' = 1, r(2)= 0.084) on this trait. Further, we demonstrate that the coding variant's effect is largely dependent on an interaction with APOE-ε4 and mediated by an increased burden of AD-related neuropathology. Finally, in our data, this coding variant is also associated with AD susceptibility (joint odds ratio = 1.4). Taken together, our analyses identify a CR1 coding variant that influences episodic memory decline; it is a variant known to alter the conformation of CR1 and points to LHR-D as the functional domain within the CR1 protein that mediates the effect on memory decline.

We identified 2,980 cerebellar cisSNP/transcript level associations (2,596 unique cisSNPs) significant in both ADs and non-ADs (q<0.05, p=7.70 × 10(-5)-1.67 × 10(-82)). Of these, 2,089 were also significant in the temporal cortex (p=1.85 × 10(-5)-1.70 × 10(-141)). The top cerebellar cisSNPs had 2.4-fold enrichment for human disease-associated variants (p<10(-6)). We identified novel cisSNP/transcript associations for human disease-associated variants, including progressive supranuclear palsy SLCO1A2/rs11568563, Parkinson's disease (PD) MMRN1/rs6532197, Paget's disease OPTN/rs1561570; and we confirmed others, including PD MAPT/rs242557, systemic lupus erythematosus and ulcerative colitis IRF5/rs4728142, and type 1 diabetes mellitus RPS26/rs1701704. In our eGWAS, there was 2.9-3.3 fold enrichment (p<10(-6)) of significant cisSNPs with suggestive AD-risk association (p<10(-3)) in the Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium GWAS. These results demonstrate the significant contributions of genetic factors to human brain gene expression, which are reliably detected across different brain regions and pathologies. The significant enrichment of brain cisSNPs among disease-associated variants advocates gene expression changes as a mechanism for many central nervous system (CNS) and non-CNS diseases. Combined assessment of expression and disease GWAS may provide complementary information in discovery of human disease variants with functional implications. Our findings have implications for the design and interpretation of eGWAS in general and the use of brain expression quantitative trait loci in the study of human disease genetics.",2012,e1002707,PLoS Genet,PubMed,PMID: 22685416 PMCID: PMC3369937,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22685416,"Alzheimer Disease; Autopsy; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; RNA; Temporal Lobe",

METHOD: Using data from 606 community-dwelling older persons without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study of aging, we examined the association of risk aversion with decision making. Risk aversion was measured using standard behavioral economics questions in which participants were asked to choose between a certain monetary payment ($15) versus a gamble in which they could gain more than $15 or gain nothing; potential gamble gains ranged from $20 to $300 with the gain amounts varied randomly over questions.

Increasing evidence suggests that older adults, even those without dementia, often make poor decisions and are selectively vulnerable to scams. To date, however, the factors associated with poor decision making in old age are unknown. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that poor decision making is a consequence of cognitive decline among older persons without Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: Participants were 420 non-demented persons from the Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal, clinical-pathologic cohort study of aging in the Chicago metropolitan area. All underwent repeated cognitive evaluations and subsequently completed assessments of decision making and susceptibility to scams. Decision making was measured using 12 items from a previously established performance-based measure and a self-report measure of susceptibility to scams. RESULTS: Cognitive function data were collected over an average of 5.5 years prior to the decision making assessment. Regression analyses were used to examine whether the prior rate of cognitive decline predicted the level of decision making and susceptibility to scams; analyses controlled for age, sex, education, and starting level of cognition. Among 420 persons without dementia, more rapid cognitive decline predicted poorer decision making and increased susceptibility to scams (p's<0.001). Further, the relations between cognitive decline, decision making and scams persisted in analyses restricted to persons without any cognitive impairment (i.e., no dementia or even mild cognitive impairment). CONCLUSIONS: Poor decision making is a consequence of cognitive decline among older persons without Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment, those widely considered ""cognitively healthy.""

Previous work has demonstrated associations between global rest-activity measures and cognitive performance on a number of tasks. Recently, we demonstrated that aging is associated with changes in the minute-to-minute fragmentation of rest-activity patterns in addition to changes in amounts of rest and activity. Given the body of experimental evidence linking sleep fragmentation with decrements in cognitive function in animals and humans, we hypothesized that increased fragmentation of rest-activity patterns would be associated with decreased cognitive function in older individuals. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. PARTICIPANTS: 700 community-dwelling individuals from the Rush Memory and Aging Project. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We obtained up to 11 days of actigraphic recordings in subjects' home environments and quantified the fragmentation of rest and activity using a recently developed state transition metric. We tested the associations between this metric and performance in 5 cognitive domains. Greater fragmentation of both rest and activity were associated with lower levels of cognitive performance, and this association was independent of total amounts of rest or activity. There was a characteristic pattern of cognitive deficits associated with rest and activity fragmentation, with preferential involvement of perceptual speed, semantic memory, working memory, and visuospatial abilities, and relative sparing of episodic memory.

Because common neuronal mechanisms may mediate the adaptation to diverse cerebral insults, we hypothesized that susceptibility for age-related cognitive decline may be due in part to a shared genetic network. We have therefore performed a genome-wide association study using a quantitative measure of global cognitive decline slope, based on repeated measures of 17 cognitive tests in 749 subjects from the Religious Orders Study. Top results were evaluated in 3 independent replication cohorts, consisting of 2279 additional subjects with repeated cognitive testing. As expected, we find that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility locus, APOE, is strongly associated with rate of cognitive decline (P(DISC) = 5.6 × 10(-9); P(JOINT)= 3.7 × 10(-27)). We additionally discover a variant, rs10808746, which shows consistent effects in the replication cohorts and modestly improved evidence of association in the joint analysis (P(DISC) = 6.7 × 10(-5); P(REP) = 9.4 × 10(-3); P(JOINT) = 2.3 × 10(-5)). This variant influences the expression of 2 adjacent genes, PDE7A and MTFR1, which are potential regulators of inflammation and oxidative injury, respectively. Using aggregate measures of genetic risk, we find that known susceptibility loci for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory diseases are not significantly associated with cognitive decline in our cohort.

There have been increasing reports of noncognitive symptoms, including loss of motor function, reported to be associated with incident AD. To understand the link between motor function and preclinical AD, this article examines: our understanding of motor function and its clinical assessment in cohort studies; the relationship of motor function and loss of cognition in older persons; risk factors for cognitive and motor decline; and the relation of post-mortem indices of AD and motor function prior to death. Together, these data suggest that age-related cognitive and motor decline may share a common causation. Furthermore, individuals with a clinical diagnosis of AD may represent the 'tip of the iceberg', since AD pathology may also account for a substantial proportion of cognitive and motor dysfunction currently considered 'normal aging' in older persons without dementia.

We tested the hypothesis that combinations of motor constructs more strongly predict adverse health outcomes in older people. METHODS: In total, 949 people without dementia, history of stroke or Parkinson's disease, who were participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project (a longitudinal community-based cohort study), underwent assessment at study entry. From this, three constructs were derived: 1) physical frailty based on grip strength, timed walk, body mass index and fatigue; 2) Parkinsonian Signs Score based on the modified motor section of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; and 3) a motor construct, based on nine strength measures and nine motor performances. Disability and cognitive status were assessed annually.

Here we hypothesized that the ""disease signature"" of AD-related cortical thinning, previously identified in patients with mild AD dementia, would be useful as a biomarker to detect anatomic abnormalities consistent with AD in cognitively normal (CN) adults who develop AD dementia after longitudinal follow-up. METHODS: We studied 2 independent samples of adults who were CN when scanned. In sample 1, 8 individuals developing AD dementia (CN-AD converters) after an average of 11.1 years were compared to 25 individuals who remained CN (CN-stable). In sample 2, 7 CN-AD converters (average follow-up 7.1 years) were compared to 25 CN-stable individuals. RESULTS: AD-signature cortical thinning in CN-AD converters in both samples was remarkably similar, about 0.2 mm (p < 0.05). Despite this small absolute difference, Cohen d effect sizes for these differences were very large (> 1). Of the 11 CN individuals with baseline low AD-signature thickness (≥ 1 SD below cohort mean), 55% developed AD dementia over nearly the next decade, while none of the 9 high AD-signature thickness individuals (≥ 1 SD above mean) developed dementia. This marker predicted time to diagnosis of dementia (hazard ratio = 3.4, p < 0.0005); 1 SD of thinning increased dementia risk by 3.4.

We evaluated associations between genotypes and rate of change in cognitive function as well as AD-related pathology. Lastly, we used pathway analysis to determine whether relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms and cognitive decline are mediated through AD pathology. RESULTS: Among our study cohort, the mean years of follow-up were 7.8 for ROS and 4.3 for MAP.

PARTICIPANTS: Older persons from 2 studies underwent annual clinical evaluations that included cognitive function testing and clinical classification of mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and Alzheimer disease. At baseline, there were 2071 individuals without dementia and 1511 without cognitive impairment. RESULTS: During follow-up, 462 persons developed Alzheimer disease (20 with dementia solely due to another condition were excluded). Five to six years before diagnosis, the rate of global cognitive decline accelerated more than 15-fold. The acceleration in cognitive decline occurred slightly earlier for semantic memory (76 months before diagnosis) and working memory (75 months) than other cognitive functions. Mild cognitive impairment was also preceded by years of cognitive decline that began earlier (80 months before diagnosis) and proceeded more rapidly (annual loss of 0.102 unit) in the amnestic than in the nonamnestic (62 months, 0.072 unit) subtype. CONCLUSION: Dementia due to Alzheimer disease is preceded by about 5 to 6 years of accelerated decline in multiple cognitive functions.

The National Institute of Aging-Late Onset Alzheimer's Disease Family Study and the National Cell Repository for Alzheimer's Disease conducted a joint genome-wide association study (GWAS) of multiplex LOAD families (3,839 affected and unaffected individuals from 992 families plus additional unrelated neurologically evaluated normal subjects) using the 610 IlluminaQuad panel. This cohort represents the largest family-based GWAS of LOAD to date, with analyses limited here to the European-American subjects. SNPs near APOE gave highly significant results (e.g., rs2075650, p = 3.2×10(-81)), but no other genome-wide significant evidence for association was obtained in the full sample. Analyses that stratified on APOE genotypes identified SNPs on chromosome 10p14 in CUGBP2 with genome-wide significant evidence for association within APOE ε4 homozygotes (e.g., rs201119, p = 1.5×10(-8)). Association in this gene was replicated in an independent sample consisting of three cohorts. There was evidence of association for recently-reported LOAD risk loci, including BIN1 (rs7561528, p = 0.009 with, and p = 0.03 without, APOE adjustment) and CLU (rs11136000, p = 0.023 with, and p = 0.008 without, APOE adjustment), with weaker support for CR1. However, our results provide strong evidence that association with PICALM (rs3851179, p = 0.69 with, and p = 0.039 without, APOE adjustment) and EXOC3L2 is affected by correlation with APOE, and thus may represent spurious association. Our results indicate that genetic structure coupled with ascertainment bias resulting from the strong APOE association affect genome-wide results and interpretation of some recently reported associations. We show that a locus such as APOE, with large effects and strong association with disease, can lead to samples that require appropriate adjustment for this locus to avoid both false positive and false negative evidence of association.

METHODS: Using data from 369 community-dwelling older persons without dementia from the Rush Memory and Aging Project, an ongoing longitudinal epidemiologic study of aging, we examined the correlates of risk aversion and tested the hypothesis that cognition is negatively associated with risk aversion. Global cognition and five specific cognitive abilities were measured via detailed cognitive testing, and risk aversion was measured using standard behavioral economics questions in which participants were asked to choose between a certain monetary payment ($15) versus a gamble in which they could gain more than $15 or gain nothing; potential gamble gains ranged from $21.79 to $151.19 with the gain amounts varied randomly over questions. We first examined the bivariate associations of age, education, sex, income and cognition with risk aversion. Next, we examined the associations between cognition and risk aversion via mixed models adjusted for age, sex, education, and income. Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses to ensure that our results were not driven by persons with preclinical cognitive impairment. RESULTS: In bivariate analyses, sex, education, income and global cognition were associated with risk aversion. However, in a mixed effect model, only sex (estimate = -1.49, standard error (SE) = 0.39, p < 0.001) and global cognitive function (estimate = -1.05, standard error (SE) = 0.34, p < 0.003) were significantly inversely associated with risk aversion. Thus, a lower level of global cognitive function and female sex were associated with greater risk aversion. Moreover, performance on four out of the five cognitive domains was negatively related to risk aversion (i.e., semantic memory, episodic memory, working memory, and perceptual speed); performance on visuospatial abilities was not.

METHODS: We considered how differences in diagnostic criteria may have contributed to these differences in AD prevalence. RESULTS: We identified several important differences in diagnostic criteria that may have contributed to the differing estimates of AD prevalence. Two factors were especially noteworthy. First, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders III-R and IV criteria of functional limitation documented by an informant used in ADAMS effectively concentrated the diagnosis of dementia toward a relatively higher level of cognitive impairment. ADAMS separately identified a category of cognitive impairment not dementia and within that group there were a substantial number of cases with ""prodromal"" AD (a maximum of 1.95 million with upweighting). Second, a substantial proportion of dementia in ADAMS was attributed to either vascular disease (representing a maximum of 0.59 million with upweighting) or undetermined etiology (a maximum of 0.34 million), whereas most dementia, including mixed dementia, was attributed to AD in the Chicago Health and Aging Project. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis of AD in population studies is a complex process. When a diagnosis of AD excludes persons meeting criteria for vascular dementia, when not all persons with dementia are assigned an etiology, and when a diagnosis of dementia requires an informant report of functional limitations, the prevalence is substantially lower and the diagnosed cases most likely have a relatively higher level of impairment.",2011-01,74-79,Alzheimers Dement,PubMed,PMID: 21255745 PMCID: PMC3145367,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21255745,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Community Health Planning; Comorbidity; Dementia; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Prevalence; United States",

Heritability in these measures was estimated using the maximum likelihood variance component method, controlling for age, gender, and education. In analyses of unaffected family members, the adjusted heritability estimates were 0.62 for episodic memory, 0.49 for semantic memory, and 0.72 for working memory, where a heritability estimate of 1 indicates that genetic factors explain all of the phenotypic variance and a heritability of 0 indicates that genetic factors explain none. Adjustment for APOE genotype had little effect on these estimates. When analyses included affected and unaffected family members, adjusted heritability estimates were lower (0.47 for episodic memory, 0.32 for semantic memory, 0.42 for working memory). Adjusting for APOE slightly reduced the estimate for episodic memory (0.40) but had no effect on the remaining estimates.

Several analytical approaches for polysomnographic data have been described. However, polysomnography is cumbersome, perturbs behavior, and is limited to short recordings. Although less physiologically comprehensive than polysomnography, actigraphy is nonintrusive, amenable to long recordings, and suited to use in subjects' natural environments, and provides an indirect measure of behavioral state. We developed a probabilistic state transition model to quantify the fragmentation of human rest-activity patterns from actigraphic data. We then applied this to the study of the temporal dynamics of rest-activity patterns in older individuals. DESIGN: Cross-sectional. SETTING: Community-based. PARTICIPANTS: 621 community-dwelling individuals without dementia participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We analyzed actigraphic data collected for up to 11 days. We processed each record to give a series of transitions between the states of rest and activity, calculated the probabilities of such transitions, and described their evolution as a function of time. From these analyses, we derived metrics of the fragmentation of rest or activity at scales of seconds to minutes. Regression modeling of the relationship of these metrics with clinical variables revealed significant associations with age, even after adjusting for sex, body mass index, and a broad range of medical comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS: Probabilistic analyses of the transition dynamics of rest-activity data provide a high-throughput, automated, quantitative, and noninvasive method of assessing the fragmentation of behavioral states suitable for large scale human and animal studies; these methods reveal age-associated changes in the fragmentation of rest-activity patterns akin to those described using polysomnographic methods.",01/11/2011,1569-1581,Sleep,PubMed,PMID: 22043128 PMCID: PMC3198212,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22043128,"Actigraphy; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; aging; Algorithms; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; mathematical modeling; Middle Aged; Sex Factors; Sleep; state transition analysis; Wakefulness",

However, the neuropathologic basis of structural MRI changes in the hippocampus in the elderly has not been directly assessed. Postmortem MRI of the aging human brain, combined with histopathology, could be an important tool to address this issue. Therefore, this study combined postmortem MRI and histopathology in 100 elderly subjects from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and the Religious Orders Study. First, to validate the information contained in postmortem MRI data, we tested the hypothesis that postmortem hippocampal volume is smaller in subjects with clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease compared to subjects with mild or no cognitive impairment, as observed in antemortem imaging studies. Subsequently, the relations of postmortem hippocampal volume to AD pathology, Lewy bodies, amyloid angiopathy, gross infarcts, microscopic infarcts, and hippocampal sclerosis were examined. It was demonstrated that hippocampal volume was smaller in persons with a clinical diagnosis of AD compared to those with no cognitive impairment (P = 2.6 × 10(-7)) or mild cognitive impairment (P = 9.6 × 10(-7)). Additionally, hippocampal volume was related to multiple cognitive abilities assessed proximate to death, with its strongest association with episodic memory. Among all pathologies investigated, the most significant factors related to lower hippocampal volume were shown to be AD pathology (P = 0.0018) and hippocampal sclerosis (P = 4.2 × 10(-7)). Shape analysis allowed for visualization of the hippocampal regions most associated with volume loss for each of these two pathologies. Overall, this investigation confirmed the relation of hippocampal volume measured postmortem to clinical diagnosis of AD and measures of cognition, and concluded that both AD pathology and hippocampal sclerosis affect hippocampal volume in old age, though the impacts of each pathology on the shape of the hippocampus may differ.",2011,e26286,PLoS One,PubMed,PMID: 22043314 PMCID: PMC3197137,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22043314,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Autopsy; Cognition Disorders; Cognitive Dysfunction; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Memory, Episodic; Organ Size",

All participants underwent detailed baseline evaluation of self-reported pain in the neck or back, hands, hips, knees, or feet, as well as annual self-reported assessments of instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), basic activities of daily living (ADLs), and mobility disability. Mobility disability was also assessed using a performance-based measure. RESULTS: The average followup was 5.6 years. Using a series of proportional hazards models that controlled for age, sex, and education, the risk of IADL disability increased by ∼10% for each additional painful area reported (hazard ratio [HR] 1.10, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.01-1.20) and the risk of ADL disability increased by ∼20% for each additional painful area (HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.11-1.31). The association with self-report mobility disability did not reach significance (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.99-1.20).

The study included 299 non-demented subjects with autopsy (185 subjects with low and 114 with high NFT levels). Both a genotype test, using logistic regression, and an allele test provided consistent evidence that variants in the RELN gene are associated with neuropathology in the context of cognitive health. Immunohistochemical data for reelin expression in AD-related brain regions added support for these findings. Reelin signaling pathways modulate phosphorylation of tau, the major component of NFTs, either directly or through β-amyloid pathways that influence tau phosphorylation.

PARTICIPANTS: Seven thousand seventy cases with AD, 3055 with autopsies, and 8169 elderly cognitively normal controls, 1092 with autopsies, from 12 different studies, including white, African American, Israeli-Arab, and Caribbean Hispanic individuals. RESULTS: Unadjusted, CLU (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.96 for single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] rs11136000), CR1 (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.07-1.22; SNP rs3818361), and PICALM (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.94, SNP rs3851179) were associated with AD in white individuals.

However, little is known of the role of these candidate genes in influencing intermediate phenotypes associated with a diagnosis of AD, including cognitive decline or AD neuropathologic burden. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Thirty-two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously implicated in AD susceptibility were genotyped in 414 subjects with both annual clinical evaluation and completed brain autopsies from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project. Regression analyses evaluated the relation of SNP genotypes to continuous measures of AD neuropathology and cognitive function proximate to death. A SNP in the zinc finger protein 224 gene (ZNF224, rs3746319) was associated with both global AD neuropathology (p = 0.009) and global cognition (p = 0.002); whereas, a SNP at the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase locus (PCK1, rs8192708) was selectively associated with global cognition (p = 3.57 x 10(-4)). The association of ZNF224 with cognitive impairment was mediated by neurofibrillary tangles, whereas PCK1 largely influenced cognition independent of AD pathology, as well as Lewy bodies and infarcts.

We tested the hypothesis that feeling alone is associated with the rate of motor decline in community-dwelling older persons. METHODS: At baseline, loneliness was assessed with a 5-item scale in 985 persons without dementia participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project, a longitudinal community-based cohort study. Annual detailed assessment of 9 measures of muscle strength and 9 motor performances were summarized in a composite measure of global motor function. RESULTS: Linear mixed-effects models which controlled for age, sex and education, showed that the level of loneliness at baseline was associated with the rate of motor decline (Estimate, -0.016; S.E. 0.006, p = 0.005). For each 1-point higher level of loneliness at baseline, motor decline was 40% more rapid; this effect was similar to the rate of motor decline observed in an average participant 4 years older at baseline. Furthermore, this amount of motor decline per year was associated with about a 50% increased risk of death. When terms for both feeling alone (loneliness) and being alone were considered together in a single model, both were relatively independent predictors of motor decline. The association between loneliness and motor decline persisted even after controlling for depressive symptoms, cognition, physical and cognitive activities, chronic conditions, as well as baseline disability or a history of stroke or Parkinson's disease.

To test the hypothesis that pulmonary function mediates the association of muscle strength with the development of mobility disability in elders, we used data from a longitudinal cohort study of 844 ambulatory elders without dementia participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project with a mean follow-up of 4.0 years (SD = 1.39). A composite measure of pulmonary function was based on spirometric measures of forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, and peak expiratory flow. Respiratory muscle strength was based on maximal inspiratory pressure and expiratory pressure and leg strength based on hand-held dynamometry. Mobility disability was defined as a gait speed less than or equal to 0.55 m/s based on annual assessment of timed walk. Secondary analyses considered time to loss of the ability to ambulate. In separate proportional hazards models which controlled for age, sex, and education, composite measures of pulmonary function, respiratory muscle strength, and leg strength were each associated with incident mobility disability (all P values < 0.001). Further, all three were related to the development of incident mobility disability when considered together in a single model (pulmonary function: hazard ratio [HR], 0.721; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.577, 0.902; respiratory muscle strength: HR, 0.732; 95% CI, 0.593, 0.905; leg strength: HR, 0.791; 95% CI, 0.640, 0.976).

Little is known about mixed pathologies in probable Alzheimer disease (AD) and about the spectrum of neuropathology in mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Using apolipoprotein E genotype (APOE), we examined whether neuropathologic intermediate phenotypes, the pathology underlying clinical AD that presumably lies intermediate in the causal chain, would increase power for genetic associations. METHODS: More than 700 older persons underwent annual evaluation and organ donation as part of the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project. A total of 536 autopsied persons with clinical AD or without dementia with APOE genotyping and a quantitative measure of AD pathology were analyzed. Regression analyses were used to examine the relation of APOE to clinical AD, to the level of cognitive function proximate to death, and to measures of AD neuropathology. RESULTS: APOE epsilon4 was associated with increased odds of clinical AD (p = 3 x 10(-7)), and its association with level of cognition was stronger (p = 8 x 10(-12)). However, the use of quantitative measures of AD pathology markedly enhanced the association (p = 9 x 10(-24)). The APOE epsilon2 was not associated with either AD (p = 0.69) or level of cognition (p = 0.82). However, its association with AD pathology (p = 1 x 10(-5)) was sufficiently strong that it would have warranted follow-up if discovered in a genome-wide association study. Power calculations demonstrate that a sample size of 625 subjects with our measure of AD pathology would be required to meet genome-wide significance of p = 5 x 10(-8) for epsilon2.

However, natural tissue decomposition and chemical fixation cause the postmortem tissue's MRI properties to be different from those found in vivo. Moreover, these properties change as postmortem fixation time elapses. The goal of this study was to characterize the T(2) relaxation changes that occur over time in cadaveric human brain hemispheres during fixation. Five hemispheres immersed in formaldehyde solution were scanned on a weekly basis for 3 months postmortem, and once again at 6 months postmortem. The T(2) relaxation times were measured throughout the hemispheres. Over time, T(2) values near the edges of the hemispheres decreased rapidly after death, while T(2) values of deep tissue decreased more slowly. This difference is likely due to the relatively large distance from the hemisphere surface, and other barriers limiting diffusion of formaldehyde molecules to deep tissues. In addition, T(2) values in deep tissue did not continuously decay to a plateau, but instead reached a minimum and then increased to a plateau. This final increase may be due to the effects of prolonged tissue decomposition, a hypothesis that is supported by numerical simulations of the fixation process.",2009-04,810-818,Magn Reson Med,PubMed,PMID: 19189294 PMCID: PMC2713761,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19189294,Brain; Fixatives; Formaldehyde; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Postmortem Changes,

Sixteen younger adults and 15 nondemented older adults performed semantic judgments (abstract/concrete) on single words in a study phase. In a test phase, identical judgments were made for repeated and new words. Younger and older adults showed similar response-time benefits (repetition priming) from repeated semantic classification. Repetition priming was associated with repetition-related reductions of prefrontal activation in both groups, but the patterns of activation differed between groups. Both groups showed similar activation reductions in dorsal left inferior prefrontal cortex (LIPFC), but older adults showed less reduction than younger adults in ventral and anterior LIPFC. Activation reductions were exclusively left-lateralized for younger adults, whereas older adults showed additional reductions in multiple regions of right frontal cortices. Right prefrontal activation reductions in older adults correlated with better repetition priming and better performance on independent tests of semantic processing.

Salubrinal, an inhibitor of eIF2alpha-P phosphatase PP1c, directly increases BACE1 and elevates Abeta production in primary neurons. Preventing eIF2alpha phosphorylation by transfection with constitutively active PP1c regulatory subunit, dominant-negative eIF2alpha kinase PERK, or PERK inhibitor P58(IPK) blocks the energy-deprivation-induced BACE1 increase. Furthermore, chronic treatment of aged Tg2576 mice with energy inhibitors increases levels of eIF2alpha-P, BACE1, Abeta, and amyloid plaques. Importantly, eIF2alpha-P and BACE1 are elevated in aggressive plaque-forming 5XFAD transgenic mice, and BACE1, eIF2alpha-P, and amyloid load are correlated in humans with AD.

If this is an effective compensatory strategy, then involvement of additional cognitive systems may help maintain function in other cognitive systems despite the accumulation of pathology.

Those who died underwent a uniform postmortem examination of the brain. Amyloid burden, density of tangles, and presence of Lewy bodies were assessed in eight brain regions and the number of chronic cerebral infarctions was noted.

We observed nearly the opposite pattern of results for successful recognition. The AMCI group displayed less activation in the medial temporal cortex but greater activation in the frontal cortex. In addition, the AMCI group showed reduced activation in the medial temporal and frontal cortices during incidental encoding of novel information during recognition.

METHODS: Participants included 148 autopsied subjects of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (mean age, 88.0 years), a longitudinal clinicopathological study. Cognition was assessed yearly with 21 neuropsychological tests. Infarcts were visualized on coronal slabs, and plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were counted and standardized to form a composite measure of AD pathology. Multiple regression analyses were used controlling for age, sex, and education. RESULTS: Fifty-three (35.8%) subjects had cerebral infarcts. After accounting for AD pathology, infarcts increased the odds of dementia by 5.1-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.98-12.92) and lowered cognitive function by 0.50 standard unit (p = 0.001). After controlling for cortical infarcts and AD pathology, subcortical infarcts, present in 39 of 53 (73.6%) subjects with infarcts, increased the odds of dementia by almost 4-fold and reduced cognitive function by more than a third of a unit (parameter estimate = -0.37; p = 0.03). In analyses with cognitive abilities, subcortical infarcts were associated with lower episodic, semantic, and working memory (p < or = 0.05), and had an interaction with AD pathology to further worsen working memory (p = 0.02).

Here we test the hypothesis that chronic psychological distress is associated with increased incidence of MCI in old age. METHODS: Participants are older persons from two cohort studies with uniform annual clinical evaluations which included detailed cognitive testing and clinical classification of MCI. We excluded persons with dementia or MCI at baseline; follow-up data were available on 1,256 persons without cognitive impairment (95% of those eligible). At baseline, they completed a six-item measure of neuroticism (mean = 15.6, SD = 6.6), an indicator of the tendency to experience psychological distress.

Because such individuals are at high risk for developing Alzheimer's disease, they are of great interest for understanding the prodromal stages of the disease process. The mechanism underlying memory dysfunction in people with MCI is not fully understood. The present study uses quantitative, high-resolution structural MRI techniques to investigate, in vivo, the anatomical substrate of memory dysfunction associated with MCI. Changes in brain structures were assessed with two imaging techniques: (i) whole-brain, voxel-based morphometry to determine regions of reduced white matter volume and (ii) sensitive volumetric segmentation of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, gray matter regions that are critically important for memory function. In participants with amnestic MCI, compared with age-matched controls, results showed a significant decrease in white matter volume in the region of the parahippocampal gyrus that includes the perforant path. There was also significant atrophy in both the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampus. Regression models demonstrated that both hippocampal volume and parahippocampal white matter volume were significant predictors of declarative memory performance. These results suggest that, in addition to hippocampal atrophy, disruption of parahippocampal white matter fibers contributes to memory decline in elderly individuals with MCI by partially disconnecting the hippocampus from incoming sensory information.",27/06/2006,10041-10045,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,PubMed,PMID: 16785436 PMCID: PMC1479867,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16785436,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amnesia; Atrophy; Brain Mapping; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory; Nerve Fibers",

METHODS: More than 2,000 persons without dementia participating in the Religious Orders Study or the Memory and Aging Project agreed to annual detailed clinical evaluation and brain donation. The studies had 19 neuropsychological performance tests in common that assessed five cognitive domains, including episodic memory, semantic memory, working memory, perceptual speed, and visuospatial ability.

We aimed to measure this effect using data from a large, longitudinal, epidemiological clinicopathological study. METHODS: 89 elderly people without known dementia participating in the Rush Memory and Aging Project underwent annual clinical evaluation. Brain autopsy was done at the time of death. Social network data were obtained by structured interview. Cognitive function tests were Z scored and averaged to yield a global and specific measure of cognitive function. Alzheimer's disease pathology was quantified as a global measure based on modified Bielschowsky silver stain. Amyloid load and the density of paired helical filament tau tangles were also quantified with antibody-specific immunostains. We used linear regression to examine the relation of disease pathology scores and social networks to level of cognitive function. FINDINGS: Cognitive function was inversely related to all measures of disease pathology, indicating lower function at more severe levels of pathology. Social network size modified the association between pathology and cognitive function (parameter estimate 0.097, SE 0.039, p=0.016, R(2)=0.295). Even at more severe levels of global disease pathology, cognitive function remained higher for participants with larger network sizes. A similar modifying association was observed with tangles (parameter estimate 0.011, SE 0.003, p=0.001, R(2)=0.454). These modifying effects were most pronounced for semantic memory and working memory. Amyloid load did not modify the relation between pathology and network size. The results were unchanged after controlling for cognitive, physical, and social activities, depressive symptoms, or number of chronic diseases.

More than 950 already have completed their baseline clinical evaluation.",2005,163-175,Neuroepidemiology,PubMed,PMID: 16103727,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16103727,"Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Autopsy; Brain; Chicago; Cognition; Cohort Studies; Data Collection; DNA; Education; Female; Humans; Male; Memory; Memory Disorders; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Research Design; Risk Factors",

In the present study, 27 patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) received a high-resolution MRI scan at baseline and were followed with yearly clinical evaluations. Ten of the 27 patients converted to AD during a 36-month period following the baseline clinical evaluation. Hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes derived from the baseline scan were compared to determine which of these two regions, known to be pathologically involved very early in the course of AD, could best differentiate MCI converters from non-converters. Although both entorhinal and hippocampal volumes were found to be independent predictors of the likelihood of conversion to AD, it was the right hemisphere entorhinal volume that best predicted conversion with a concordance rate of 93.5%.",2004-10,1197-1203,Neurobiol Aging,PubMed,PMID: 15312965,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15312965,"Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Atrophy; Cognition Disorders; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Progression; Entorhinal Cortex; Female; Functional Laterality; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results",

We constructed a questionnaire consisting of 25 items about frequency of participation in cognitive activities across the life span and administered it to two groups of older persons. The total score on the scale had high internal consistency (coefficient alpha = 0.88) and temporal stability over a 4-week re-test interval (r = 0.79), and it was positively correlated with education. In analyses controlling for age, sex, and education, more frequent cognitive activity was related to better perceptual speed, visuospatial ability, and semantic memory but not to episodic memory or working memory.

Here, we integrate a large GWAS on blood lipids involving 1.6 million individuals from five ancestries with a wide array of functional genomic datasets to discover regulatory mechanisms underlying lipid associations. We first prioritize lipid-associated genes with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) colocalizations and then add chromatin interaction data to narrow the search for functional genes. Polygenic enrichment analysis across 697 annotations from a host of tissues and cell types confirms the central role of the liver in lipid levels and highlights the selective enrichment of adipose-specific chromatin marks in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Overlapping transcription factor (TF) binding sites with lipid-associated loci identifies TFs relevant in lipid biology. In addition, we present an integrative framework to prioritize causal variants at GWAS loci, producing a comprehensive list of candidate causal genes and variants with multiple layers of functional evidence. We highlight two of the prioritized genes, CREBRF and RRBP1, which show convergent evidence across functional datasets supporting their roles in lipid biology.",04/08/2022,1366-1387,Am J Hum Genet,PubMed,PMID: 35931049 PMCID: PMC9388392,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35931049,"Chromatin; complex traits; fine-mapping; functional genomics; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; lipid biology; Lipids; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; post-GWAS; regulatory mechanism; variant prioritization",

We use data from two community-based, clinical-pathologic cohorts to examine the association of age with AD and other common pathologies. Participants were 1420 autopsied individuals from the Religious Orders Study or Rush Memory and Aging Project who underwent annual clinical evaluations for diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and level of cognition. The neuropathologic traits of interest were pathologic AD according to modified NIA-Reagan criteria, three quantitative measures of AD pathology (global AD pathology score, β-amyloid load and PHFtau tangle density), macro- and micro-scopic infarcts, neocortical Lewy bodies, TDP-43 and hippocampal sclerosis. Semiparametric generalized additive models examined the nonlinear relationship between age and the clinical and pathological outcomes. The probability of Alzheimer's dementia at death increased with age such that for every additional year of age, the log odds of Alzheimer's dementia was 0.067 higher, corresponding to an odds ratio of 1.070 (p < 0.001). Results were similar for cognitive impairment and level of cognition. By contrast, a nonlinear relationship of age with multiple indices of AD pathology was observed (all ps < 0.05), such that pathologic AD reached a peak around 95 years of age and leveled off afterwards; the quantitative measures of AD pathology were significantly lower at ages above 95. The association of age with other neuropathologies was quite distinct from that of AD in that most increased with advancing age. AD pathology appears to peak around 95 years of age while other common pathologies continue to increase with age.",03/07/2019,104,Acta Neuropathol Commun,PubMed,PMID: 31269985 PMCID: PMC6609405,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31269985,"Age; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Alzheimer’s disease; Amyloid; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Neuropathology; Neuropsychological Tests; Tau protein",
